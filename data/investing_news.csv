    </div>
        <p>Investing.com - U.S. soybean futures fell to a five-week low on Monday, as ample global supplies and a broadly stronger U.S. dollar weighed.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc3450489743"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">US soybeans</a></span> for May delivery dipped 0.28 cents, or 0.03%, to trade at $9.7313 a bushel during U.S. morning hours after hitting an intraday low of $9.6740, a level not seen since February 11.</p>
<p>The May soybean contract tumbled 16.4 cents, or 1.67%, on Friday. Prices of the oilseed slumped 13.63 cents, or 1.08%, last week, the second straight weekly loss, amid optimism over the outlook for global supplies</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture left its forecast for domestic soybean stocks at the end of the 2014-15 season unchanged at 385 million bushels earlier in the month.</p>
<p>According to the agency, global soybean ending stocks were expected to total 89.5 million tons, up from 89.26 million tons estimated last month.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/us-dollar-index"" id=""5fc3450489a91"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8827"">U.S. dollar index</a></span>, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was at 100.35 after rallying to 100.71 earlier, the highest level since April 2003.</p>
<p>A stronger dollar reduces the appeal of U.S. crops to overseas buyers and makes commodities less attractive as an alternative investment.</p>
<p>Demand for the dollar continued to be underpinned amid expectations for higher interest rates in the U.S. as early as in June.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc3450489bc8"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">US corn</a></span> for May delivery shed 2.02 cents, or 0.53%, to trade at $3.7838 a bushel. Prices fell to a session low of $3.7760 earlier, the weakest level since February 3.</p>
<p>On Friday, US corn for May delivery tumbled 8.0 cents, or 2.06%, to close at $3.8040. The May corn contract ticked down 5.62 cents, or 1.36%, last week, the second consecutive weekly decline.</p>
<p>The USDA said that U.S. corn inventories at the end of the 2014-15 season in August will total 1.777 billion bushels, down 50 million bushels from a previous estimate of 1.827 billion bushels.</p>
<p>The agency also projected global ending corn stockpiles at 185.28 million metric tons for the 2014-15 season, down from a previous forecast of 189.64 million tons.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the Chicago Board of Trade, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc3450489cff"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">US wheat</a></span> for May delivery dipped 1.48 cents, or 0.29%, to trade at $5.0013 a bushel.</p>
<p>The May wheat contract rose 17.0 cents, or 3.94%, last week, as prices remained supported after the USDA lowered its outlook for domestic and global supplies earlier in the week.</p>
<p>Domestic wheat reserves in the season ending in May were expected to total 691 million bushels, down slightly from last month’s forecast of 692 million.</p>
<p>According to the USDA, global ending wheat inventories will total 197.71 million tons, down from a forecast of 197.85 in February.</p>
<p>Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, government figures show. Wheat was fourth, behind hay.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">“It turns out that was correct as the USDA did confirm that China got to the checkout line with 132,000 metric tonnes, and right behind them was someone who could not be identified, with an additional 318,000.&nbsp; All this has been enough to lift bean futures into slightly higher highs for the swing.”</p>

These fears are based on good, solid fundamentals and the funds are short. With these factors in place, the selling pressure could be daunting.

We may have already (too early?) priced in weak exports and another bumper crop. With summer beginning tomorrow we still have a season to go through before we have autumn and harvest pressure. And the market would love to see more premium before sellers are&nbsp;in and dated.</p>
<p>There are still components that could change this market other than weather that traders will be looking over their shoulder. Funds that are heavily short could start to cover, or change bias on, their positions with exports and the value of the US <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/usdollar"" id=""5fc3527149d95"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""942611"">dollar</a></span> squarely on their mind. One thing is for sure that keeps farmers and investors guessing, is what is fair value for the price of crops. In the overnight electronic session the July corn is currently trading at 332 ½ which is 1 ½ of a cent higher. The trading range has been 333 to 327 ½.</p>
<p>On the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/ethanol-futures"" id=""5fc3527149eb7"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""961732"">ethanol</a></span> market, we are seeing improved production and improved demand. Minnesota based POET plant manager Chris Hanson said, “We shut down half of our production. This affected peoples livelihoods and pay,” both in industry and in agriculture, he said. ""If you look at a plant like mine, maybe we didn’t buy a million bushels that we would have, so those farmers don’t have somewhere to bring that million bushels of corn. There aren’t new consumers looking for that grain.” Brian Kletscher CEO with Hightower Ethanol, said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kletcher's plant was able to keep running this spring, but at a reduced capacity. He continued, “On March 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;we cut production by approximately 22% to 25% and we remained at that reduced rate until the middle of May,” Kletscher said. “We didn’t make money at all, but we were able to run through April with trying to minimize our loss.” He also said Hightower’s production is back up to 90% now.&nbsp; He continued, “We still are watching the ethanol market and fuel usage through the United States.” In the overnight electronic session the July contract posted a trade at 1.230 which is unchanged with 1 contract traded. The market is currently showing 1 bid @ 1.180 and 3 offers @ 1.240 with Open Interest dropping to 64 contracts and the August contract slowly picking up the slack with 32 Open Positions.</p>

In the overnight electronic session August crude oil is currently trading at $40.00 which is 95 cents higher. The trading range has been $38.93-40.44. You still want to steer clear of the July contract, given today's expiry on ICE (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/intercontintlex"" id=""5fc352714a0b2"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""7907"">ICE</a></span>) and on Monday on CME.</p>

<p>Price momentum and relative strength indicators on the monthly chart are falling, and historical volatility is rising as monthly trading ranges have expanded.

<p>Increasing open interest along with falling price is typically a technical validation of a bearish trend in a futures market. The technical signs in the Dollar Index are pointing lower.</p>

<p>Speculative accounts were not expecting this rally, having reduced net long positions for a second week in the week to September 17. Net longs are now at the lowest in four weeks.</p>

The metal looks set to rise for an eighth consecutive week after pausing between March and August. A combination of tight supply and a more positive outlook for global car demand once the US and China agree a trade deal pulled prices higher.</p>
<p>Speculative accounts added to net long positions for a second straight week in the week to September 17, and they are now the highest since the week of July 30.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/platinum"" id=""5fc34a05d8c94"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8910"">PLATINUM</a></span></strong> touched the highest in 11 days early this morning but has since reversed and is now facing its first down-day in four days. Speculative investors appear not to be convinced that the metal has further upside as they turned net sellers in the week to September 17, according to the latest CFTC report, pulling net longs from a six-month high.</p>

Optimism surrounding US-China trade talks drove the rebound amid hopes for an earlier-than-expected round of high-level talks. Speculative investors scaled back their net short positions for a second week, CFTC data to September 17 show.</p>

Tensions in the Gulf remain high, though as yet there has been no aggressive response from either Saudi Arabia or its allies.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia was quick to assure the market that almost all of the facilities would be back to near full production by the end of this month, though those who have been tasked with making it happen have suggested it may take longer, according to reports from <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/us-30"" id=""5fc34a05d8eb7"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""169"">Dow</a></span> Jones.</p>
<p>Prices posted the biggest weekly gain since June last week after the attacks cut Saudi production and this has caused ratings agency Moody’s to scale back its output forecast to 9.7 million barrels per day. As a result, it also lowered its forecast for Saudi Arabia’s 2019 growth to just 0.3% from 1.5% previously.</p>

The average increase in the 2014-2918 period was 74 billion bcf per week, according to Bloomberg calculations.</p>
<p>Speculative investors have been net buyers of the commodity for the past five weeks and net short positions, which have been in place since February 12, have been trimmed to the least since June 4.</p>
<p>Prices have failed to sustain a breach of the 200-day moving average, now at 2.626, on a closing basis that occurred on September 16 and prices have now retraced back below it.</p>

We’ve been here before and if the high level talks in 1-2 weeks’ time don’t produce any concrete progress, then those gains could be quickly wiped out.

However, prices snapped a run a seven weeks of lower closes last week and appears to be extending those gains into this week. Rumours of a temporary supply shortage for the 2019/20 season is forcing a short squeeze on positioning.

The US is the world’s leading producer and exporter of corn, while Brazil is the top producer of free-market sugar. The two countries lead the world in ethanol output using excess agricultural commodity production.</p>
<p>Over the past years, corn’s role in US ethanol production served two purposes. Increased demand for corn was supportive of US farmers. At the same time, an ethanol blend in <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gasoline-rbob"" id=""5fc3532ad790e"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""954867"">gasoline</a></span> is supposed to be environmentally friendly, and it reduced dependence on <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc3532ad7a47"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">crude oil</a></span> from the Middle East.</p>
<p>Corn and ethanol share a bond in the US, as each can impact the other’s supply and demand fundamentals. The price of ethanol followed oil and gasoline prices lower during the massive selloff in February through April. Both ethanol and gasoline futures fell to lows in late March. Since then, the biofuel and the oil product have made significant comebacks.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Ethanol prices rise with energy</strong></h2><p>After trading to a low of negative $40.32 per barrel on April 20, the price of nearby crude oil futures on NYMEX was over $80 per barrel higher at the end of last week, at above $41 on the active month August contract. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/natural-gas"" id=""5fc3532ad7b7f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8862"">Natural gas</a></span> hit a low of $1.432 in late June and recovered to $1.718 on Friday, July 17. The ethanol price moved higher with the energy commodities. </p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img title=""Ethenol Weekly "" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picbe38990a2c038c808c1f9bba2caaa12d.png"" alt=""Ethenol Weekly ""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Ethenol Weekly </span></div></div></div><p></p>

<p>The weekly chart shows that nearby ethanol futures rose from a record low at 79.9 cents per gallon during the final week of March to a high of $1.40 on July 10. The price pulled back to the $1.17 level at the end of last week, which was still 46.4% higher than the record low.</p><h2><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Ethanol outperforms corn</strong></h2><p>The ethanol futures market tends to follow energy prices, but it is also highly sensitive to the price action in corn futures. </p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img title=""Corn Weekly"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picbc68e707b8c0276a9a0963c59f897f6a.png"" alt=""Corn Weekly""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Corn Weekly</span></div></div></div><em>&nbsp;</em><p></p>
<p>The weekly chart illustrates that nearby corn futures hit bottom for 2020 at $3.0025 in late April. A recovery took the price of the coarse grain to a high of $3.5650 earlier this month. At $3.3350 at the end of last week, corn had recovered from the low by 11% as the input into ethanol production underperformed the biofuel.</p>
<p>Refiners who process corn into ethanol have benefited from the differential as the price of the input, corn, rose less than the output, ethanol. Companies like Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/archer-daniels-mid"" id=""5fc3532ad7cfe"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8080"">ADM</a></span>), Bunge (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/bunge"" id=""5fc3532ad7e2f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""39190"">BG</a></span>), and some oil refining companies saw their margins improve as corn underperformed the price action in the ethanol market on a percentage basis.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><strong>The biofuel may see lots of volatility in the run-up to the 2020 US election</strong></h2><p>The US election in early November will determine the path of energy policy in the world’s leading oil and gas producing nation. President Trump favors energy independence and a continuation of the production of fossil fuels. The challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden, supports the “<em>Green New Deal</em>,” which could limit or eliminate the production of hydrocarbons starting in 2021.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the vast gap between the candidate’s platforms could lead to increased volatility in energy prices over the coming weeks and months. The fundamental supply and demand equations for crude oil, natural gas, and ethanol could change dramatically on the back of US energy policy.</p>
<p>Fasten your seatbelts, the wide variance in the energy markets during the first half of 2020 is likely to continue for the rest of this year. When it comes to ethanol, energy and corn prices will continue to determine the path of least resistance for the biofuel.</p>

        <p>Investing.com - U.S. wheat futures fell to a contract low on Friday, before rebounding slightly as investors returned to the market to seek cheap valuations.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc344d2052b9"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">US wheat</a></span> for May delivery inched up 2.0 cents, or 0.42%, on Friday to settle at $4.8240 a bushel by close of trade.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, wheat prices touched $4.7840, the lowest level on record, as concerns over ample global supplies and indications of reduced demand for U.S. wheat weighed.</p>
<p>A broadly stronger U.S. dollar also weighed. The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/us-dollar-index"" id=""5fc344d20568f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8827"">dollar index</a></span>, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, jumped 1.39% to 97.74 late Friday, the highest since September 2003.</p>
<p>A stronger dollar reduces the appeal of U.S. crops to overseas buyers and makes commodities less attractive as an alternative investment.</p>
<p>On the week, the May wheat contract tumbled 31.5 cents, or 5.81%, the worst weekly loss since September.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc344d2057af"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">US corn</a></span> for May delivery dipped 4.4 cents, or 1.15%, on Friday to close at $3.8600 a bushel. Prices touched an intraday low of $3.8320 earlier, the weakest level since February 26, as weakness in wheat spilled over.</p>
<p>Wheat and corn prices are linked because both can be used as animal feed.</p>
<p>For the week, the May corn contract ticked down 6.76 cents, or 1.53%.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the Chicago Board of Trade, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc344d2058c6"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">US soybeans</a></span> for May delivery fell to $9.7660 a bushel on Friday, the lowest since February 12, before ending down 0.4 cents, or 0.05%, at $9.8500, as concerns over Brazilian export prospects eased.</p>
<p>The May soybean contract slumped 44.74 cents, or 4.37%, last week, the first weekly loss in five weeks, as a two-week strike by Brazilian truck drivers appeared to be coming to an end.</p>
<p>Brazil is a major soybean exporter and competes with the U.S. for business on the global market.</p>
<p>In the week ahead, market players will focus on the release of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's world supply and demand report on Tuesday, March 10.</p>
<p>The agency will also produce data on crop progress and weekly export sales figures.</p>

        <p>Investing.com - U.S. wheat futures declined for the second consecutive session on Tuesday, as forecasts for much-needed rainfall in the U.S. grain belt eased concerns over the health of the winter-wheat crop.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc3457eb0f5d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">US wheat</a></span> for May delivery fell 4.83 cents, or 0.91%, to trade at $5.2338 a bushel during U.S. morning hours.</p>
<p>A day earlier, wheat lost 8.4 cents, or 1.59%, to settle at $5.2760, as updated weather models forecast much-needed rains in key U.S. wheat-growing states.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture said Monday that the U.S. winter wheat crop was rated 44% good to excellent, compared to 35% in the same week a year earlier. The five-year average for the first week in April is 47%.</p>

On Monday, corn dipped 1.4 cents, or 0.39%, to end at $3.8500 amid indications of ample supplies.</p>
<p>The USDA said last week that U.S. corn inventories on March 1 totaled 7.745 billion bushels, 11% higher than last year.</p>
<p>The agency also projected U.S. farmers would plant 89.199 million acres with corn in 2015, surpassing forecasts for 88.735 million but down from 90.597 million in 2014.</p>

<p>Optimism over the outlook for supplies in Brazil and Argentina has weighed on soybeans in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Brazil and Argentina are major soybean exporters and compete with the U.S. for business on the global market. Large South American crop prospects could weigh on demand for U.S. supplies.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">“Moreover, traders will need to watch for a potential increase in sugar supplies from Brazil in the next few months as its harvest season gets into full swing this spring.""<br><br>“In view of these factors, a heavy cash position is recommended for now as we wait for the damage inflicted on the market by the coronavirus to abate.""</p>

<p><strong>Regardless of the dollar's role and function in the world economy and the halls of finance, in the near and intermediate terms, investors and businesses are more concerned with foreign exchange prices. </strong>The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/us-dollar-index"" id=""5fc34d0deae77"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8827"">greenback</a></span> has fallen out of favor. Its main supports, like wide interest rate differentials, favorable growth differentials, and political certainty if not stability, have weakened. The pace accelerated from mid-June through the end of July. It seems to have entered a consolidative or corrective phase, perhaps aided by the stabilization of yields as participants make room for the quarterly refunding, and a surge in coupon issuance through October.</p>
<p><strong>The upcoming US data features <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cpi-69"" id=""5fc34d0dec5cc"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""69"">July CPI</a></span>, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/retail-sales-256"" id=""5fc34d0dec6d8"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""256"">retail sales</a></span>, and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/industrial-production-161"" id=""5fc34d0dec7cf"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""161"">industrial production</a></span> figures. </strong>Taken as a whole, the data are likely to show that the US economic activity moderated from the pace seen in June. The July <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/nonfarm-payrolls-227"" id=""5fc34d0dec894"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""227"">job figures</a></span> showed a disturbingly low number of returning workers in manufacturing. The 26k increase paled in comparison to the median forecast for 255k and June's 357k increase. Losses were reported in the production of computers and electronic goods, fabricated metals, and machinery. The auto sector, which has been a bit of an economic catalyst in Canada, and to a lesser extent, Mexico, as well as the US, saw another 39k workers return.</p>
<p><strong>Retail sales are forecast to rise by around 1.8% after the sizzling 7.5% month-over-month gain in June. </strong>The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/core-retail-sales-63"" id=""5fc34d0dec980"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""63"">core measures</a></span>, which exclude autos, gasoline, and building materials, may slow to a still-strong 0.9% from 5.6%, according to the median forecast in the Bloomberg survey. Similarly, the growth in industrial output is also likely to slow. The median forecast calls for a 3% rise after a 5.4% gain in June. The pace of recovery in the manufacturing sector may have moderated to&nbsp; 2.9% from 7.2%. Given the manufacturing employment disappointment, the risk would seem to lie to the downside. Year-over-year measures of headline and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/core-cpi-56"" id=""5fc34d0dece1c"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""56"">core CPI</a></span> may ease.</p>
<p><strong>The surge in German June <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/german-factory-orders-130"" id=""5fc34d0decf1b"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""130"">factory orders</a></span> and the jump in <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/german-industrial-production-135"" id=""5fc34d0ded020"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""135"">industrial output</a></span> shows the momentum at the start of the Q3. </strong>The four largest countries reported June industrial production that was above expectations, and not by just a narrow margin. The median forecast was for <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/french-industrial-production-115"" id=""5fc34d0ded47f"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""115"">France</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/italian-industrial-production-180"" id=""5fc34d0ded904"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""180"">Italy</a></span>'s output to expand by 8.4% and 5%, and instead, production increased by 12.7% and 8.2%, respectively. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/spanish-industrial-production-403"" id=""5fc34d0dedd33"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""403"">Spain</a></span>'s 14% increase easily bettered the median projection of a 10% increase. The sharp rise in German capital equipment orders and EMU orders, more broadly, will likely provide another data point for the narrative that sees a stronger recovery in Europe. There may be an upside surprise to the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/industrial-production-160"" id=""5fc34d0dede13"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""160"">industrial output</a></span> for EMU countries that will be reported in the week ahead. The aggregate gain is forecast to have risen by 10.0% by the median projection in the Bloomberg survey. It rose by12.4% in May. The chart here is monthly changes in the US (yellow) and EMU (white) industrial output.</p>

<p><strong>Europe's trade surplus is also likely to have continued to recover. </strong>The eurozone's trade surplus averaged 18.7 bln euros a month in 2019, and as the world economy came to a screeching stop, the trade surplus fell to 1.5 bln euros in April. It grew to 8 bln euros in May and is poised to rise further in June. The aggregate figure will be reported, but Spain's estimate is not released until August 20, and that ought to be the lede. For at least three decades, Spain has run a trade surplus on a monthly basis exactly two times before May. In May, the disruptions in trade and uneven contagions and recoveries and contagions resulted in a very small (~124.5 mln euros) trade surplus.</p>
<p><strong>China reports yuan loans, aggregate financing, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/industrial-production-462"" id=""5fc34d0dedee4"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""462"">industrial production</a></span>, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/fixed-asset-investment-460"" id=""5fc34d0dee2d9"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""460"">fixed-asset investment</a></span>, and surveyed <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/chinese-unemployment-rate-1793"" id=""5fc34d0dee7d0"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1793"">unemployment</a></span>. </strong>The takeaway is that the world's second-largest economy is continuing to recover, but the pace has moderated. The PBOC is one of the few major central banks that has not engaged an asset purchase program, and it is moving to slow the rapid expansion of loans. Aggregate financing, which includes the formal banking system and the shadow banking sector, average CNY1.65 trillion a month in 2019, and more than doubled in Q1 to CNY3.7 trillion. In Q2 is slowed to CNY3.2 trillion and is likely to fall further in Q3, beginning with the July report.</p>
<p><strong>Around the end of next week, senior US and Chinese officials will have a conference call to review Phase 1 of the trade deal, which seems a bit pretentious given that there is unlikely to be a Phase 2. </strong>It seems clear to everyone who looks at the data that China is so far behind its quantitative targets that it is nearly impossible for it to fulfill its obligations. China's July trade figures, released before the weekend, showed <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/imports-867"" id=""5fc34d0dee8dc"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""867"">imports</a></span> from the US had&nbsp;<em>fallen&nbsp;</em>by 3.5% year-to-date. The question is what to do about it. Up until now, the mantra has been the trade agreement is on track (don't believe your lying eyes). There is bound to be some headline risk around the review.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ironically, President Trump's confrontation with China was one of the few bipartisan developments over the last couple of years. </strong>Even if there were some tactical differences, Democrat leaders often applauded Trump's strong stance. The Democrats' criticism of the US policy toward China is that it is not sufficiently effective because the traditional allies have been cast aside or alienated.</p>
<p><strong>The transformation and deterioration of the US-Sino relationship began when American leaders concluded that Xi's era, for as long as it lasts,&nbsp; is a break from the Hu Jintao era (2002-2012) of ""peaceful rise"" or ""peaceful development.""&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Xi goes against Deng Xiaoping's instruction to ""keep a low profile and never take the lead.""&nbsp; He wants to flex China's muscles, sparred with India, clamped down on Hong Kong, and continues to harass Taiwan. At the same time, the US also has experienced its political center shifting in a more economic nationalist direction. The Democrat Party Platform on which Biden is running offers some variations on the common theme.</p>
<p><strong>Some fraction of China's ""underperformance"" is a function of a shift in prices. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc34d0deb1ef"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">Crude oil</a></span> prices are still off more than a quarter this year. </strong>The price of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34d0deb439"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soy</a></span> is off around 10%. Rather than focus on quantities, the US may have made a tactical error by focusing on dollar value. From a broader view, the push for a specific outcome is an abandonment of the traditional US approach of focusing on processes. It no longer sounds or acts like that confident country at the start of the 20th century that defended China's territorial integrity against Europe and Japan's attempts to carve up China into ""concessions.""&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The concession the US negotiated with China is only one of several fronts where national interests are clashing. </strong>Mobile apps have become part of the contested terrain. As we noted previously, India may have been the most aggressive in banning some Chinese apps. The US will ban TikTok and WeChat. Microsoft (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/microsoft-corp"" id=""5fc34d0deb51c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""252"">MSFT</a></span>), who seems to the untrained eye to have a monopoly or oligopolistic control (operating systems), may be taking these monopoly rents to buy all or part of TikTok, a Chinese-based app platform of short video clips (less than a minute).</p>
<p><strong>As hard as it may have been to secure in the first place, getting out of the Phase 1 trade agreement maybe even tricker. </strong>The proverbial can could be kicked down the road and double up next year's efforts. The targets can be extended another year. New tariffs could be imposed to theoretically provide greater inducement to comply. Yet, at the coming review, it may serve both sides' interests to say something that is innocuous and bland, like both sides remain committed to the agreement.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- Bitterly cold weather in the middle of the U.S. is threatening wheat plants as cattle battle to stay warm.</p>
<p>A wide swath of the U.S. wheat belt faced readings below 0 Fahrenheit (-18 Celsius) on Monday, damaging crops that didn’t have a protective layer of snow, according to World Weather Inc. Temperatures through Jan. 4 are forecast at 15 to 25 degrees below normal from the Southern Plains to Ohio Valley, the National Weather Service forecasts. The chill can also slow grain movement as ice builds on rivers and railways.</p>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc347723b7ae"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">March futures</a></span> tracking both hard red winter and soft red winter wheat climbed to the highest since early December in Chicago, while the February cattle contract reached a one-month high. Feeder-cattle futures rose as much as 4.5 cents, the exchange limit.</p>
<p>For wheat, “widespread winterkill occurred on Monday across southeastern Colorado, much of Kansas, far northern Oklahoma, central Missouri, southern Illinois, and southwestern Indiana,” according to Radiant Solutions.</p>
<p>The full extent of the grain damage won’t be known until the crop begins to grow again in the spring, said Mike O’Dea, risk management consultant for INTL FCStone in Kansas City, Missouri. Winter wheat is planted in the fall and lies dormant during the winter months until warmer weather triggers further plant development. Several of the top U.S. growing states have also faced an expanding drought in the past few months.</p>
<p>The cold weather means it takes longer for cattle to add pounds, though the impact isn’t expected to last long, said Dennis Smith, a senior account executive at Archer Financial Services in Chicago. While hogs and poultry are primarily raised indoors, cattle graze on pastureland and bulk up in outdoor feedlots throughout the year.</p>
<p>“When it’s so cold, they have to consume so much energy just to stay warm that the weight gain is going to be minimal,” Smith said. Once the freeze ends, “they also will probably recover fairly quickly because it’s not going to be a huge muddy mess,” thanks to recent dry weather, he said.</p>

<div>The National Hurricane Center issued yet another advisory about a Disturbance moving towards the Gulf Coast direction when we are still counting and assessing the casualties after Hurricane Zeta. This Disturbance has a 40% chance to form hurricane status in the next 48 hours and 80% in the next five days.

Which can be scary in futures trading. With this drop in prices expect China and other countries to take advantage of the lower price swing and import more U.S. ag products. Even with the election on Tuesday, it is clear that U.S. demand is increasing, and other buyers know they have to buy our goods and may take advantage of the dip in prices. I expect when the wind blows in this latest pandemic scare, it will go away, and the market will have a positive perspective, which should drive prices higher.

With local governments here in the U.S. going back to shut business’ down AGAIN, instead of keeping business open with an agreement of social distancing and regulate to keep the business open and not shut it down. Also, if Saudi Arabia and Russia forgot their little price war with the pandemic raging at the time and put prices in the negative, their memory has failed them. If they decide to boost production, all I can say, I saw this movie before and know how it ends. When they drive people to not agree and demand and production numbers change like the U.S. foreign debt, we will find demand creep up back in the picture as it has so many times before.

<p>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc3455878be3"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">US wheat</a></span> for May delivery hit an intraday peak of $5.3150 a bushel, the most since March 23, before trading at $5.2663 during U.S. morning hours, down 3.38 cents, or 0.64%.</p>
<p>A day earlier, wheat rallied 22.4 cents, or 4.43%, to settle at $5.3020 as a lack of rainfall in the U.S. grain belt fuelled concerns over the health of the winter-wheat crop.</p>
<p>According to the USDA, Oklahoma winter wheat was rated 44% good to excellent, up from 40% in the previous week, while Texas winter wheat improved by 4% to 55%.</p>
<p>In Kansas, the top wheat-producing state, the wheat crop was rated 41% good to excellent, unchanged from the preceding week.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the Chicago Board of Trade, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc3455878fc4"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">US corn</a></span> for May delivery tacked on 0.47 cents, or 0.12%, to trade at $3.9488 a bushel. US corn for May delivery rose 3.4 cents, or 0.9%, on Monday to close at $3.9440.</p>
<p>The USDA's prospective plantings report is likely to show farmers in the U.S. cut corn sowings this spring in favor of planting more-profitable soybeans.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc3455879094"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">US soybeans</a></span> for May delivery dipped 2.62 cents, or 0.27%, to trade at $9.6438 a bushel after touching a daily low of $9.6413, the weakest level since March 20. On Monday, US soybeans for May delivery inched up 0.4 cents, or 0.05%, to end at $9.6760.</p>
<p>Optimism over the outlook for supplies in Brazil and Argentina drove down prices.</p>
<p>Brazil and Argentina are major soybean exporters and compete with the U.S. for business on the global market. Large South American crop prospects could weigh on demand for U.S. supplies.</p>
<p>Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, government figures show. Wheat was fourth, behind hay.</p>

1606634674-5042,https://www.investing.com/commodities/us-soybeans-opinion/4,Asia Session: China’s U.S. Agriculture Import Halt Ignored By Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/chinas-shot-across-the-bows-ignored-200526376,"By MarketPulse (Jeffrey Halley)Market OverviewJun 02, 2020 02:59AM ET","<p><strong>China’s instruction to state-owned produce buyers to halt purchases of US <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34caae673c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/lean-hogs"" id=""5fc34caae6bc9"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8913"">pork</a></span> caused only a temporary blip in markets overnight.</strong> Digging a little deeper, private companies were not issued the same orders and the exercise—along with the PBOC's <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-cny"" id=""5fc34caae6cf1"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""2111"">USD/CNY</a></span> fixes recently—appears to be more a shot across the bows of the US over Hong Kong, and not an imminent threat of withdrawal from the US-China trade agreement. That, off course, would help precisely no one in these difficult times.</p>
<p>Markets quickly recovered their composure, despite disappointing PMI data from <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/german-manufacturing-pmi-136"" id=""5fc34caae9129"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""136"">Germany</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/french-manufacturing-pmi-340"" id=""5fc34caae9245"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""340"">France</a></span>, and moved back to their happy place, the global recovery trade. Equities and energy continued to perform well, and the rotation out of US dollars continued at pace, most noticeably with the commodity currencies.</p>
<p>The US riots, disturbing as they are, are also being discounted in the greater economic picture. Rightly so, without sounding insensitive, as they are unlikely to derail the expected US rebound. Whether the lack of social distancing by protestors, police and soldiers comes back to bite them, is a story for another day.</p>
<p>After a strong start in Asia yesterday, that effectively led the US session, the region's stock markets continue to probe higher, although with less verve than the previous session. The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/rba-interest-rate-decision-171"" id=""5fc34caae9325"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""171"">Reserve Bank of Australia</a></span> has left its cash target rate unchanged at 0.25%, and its <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/rates-bonds/australia-3-year-bond-yield"" id=""5fc34caae6dfe"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""23871"">3-year</a></span> bond yield target unchanged at 0.25%. It has reiterated that policy will remain easy for as long as necessary, noting that the economy remains weak despite some nascent signs of recovery in some areas. There was nothing unexpected in either the decision or comments though, and the fallout on the Australian dollar will be minimal as it rides the strong trade winds of the global recovery expectations across the world.</p>
<p>Overnight, Moody’s downgraded India’s sovereign rating to just one notch above junk. The reasons cited were a slowing economy due to the pandemic, government finances and policy ineffectiveness, and a continued degrading of the financial sectors creditworthiness profile. The latter was already a significant issue in India before COVID-19 and has been exacerbated since. That will likely cap India’s markets today and maintain pressure on the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-inr"" id=""5fc34caae6f73"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""160"">Indian rupee</a></span>.</p>
<p>The data calendar for the rest of the day across the globe is strictly second tier, meaning that markets will happily continue their bullish outlook unless we receive a headline bomb. Tomorrow sees Australian <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/gdp-124"" id=""5fc34caae9419"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""124"">GDP</a></span> and China <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/caixin-services-pmi-596"" id=""5fc34caae9d71"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""596"">Services PMI</a></span>, with both having the potential to outperform adding more fuel to the peak-virus fire in regional asset markets.</p>
<h2><strong>Equity rally continues, albeit at a more muted pace</strong></h2>
<p>Asian equities are mostly in the green today with the outperformer being Jakarta. The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/idx-composite"" id=""5fc34caae70bf"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""29049"">JCI</a></span> is playing catch-up for the past week, rising 2.40% as Indonesia returns from its extended end of Ramadan holiday. The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/japan-ni225"" id=""5fc34caae7208"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""178"">Nikkei 225</a></span> has risen 1.20% with the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/kospi"" id=""5fc34caae734c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""37426"">KOSPI</a></span> all up 0.80%. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/hang-sen-40"" id=""5fc34caae7492"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""179"">Hong Kong</a></span> has risen 0.50% with <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/ftse-singapore"" id=""5fc34caae75e1"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""28869"">Singapore</a></span> climbing an impressive 1.30%.</p>
<p>Mainland China exchanges are nearly unchanged on the day with the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/shanghai-composite"" id=""5fc34caae7d72"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""40820"">Shanghai Composite</a></span> down 0.15%, and the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/csi300"" id=""5fc34caae7e9f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""940801"">CSI 300</a></span> flat. The lack of excitement in China likely reflects concerns that US-China trade issues, and Hong Kong, have only in a temporary lull.</p>
<p>Overall, however, the global recovery trade remains in full swing, powered by unlimited central bank money and the end of national lockdowns across the developed world. Momentum remains strong, and global equity markets look set to stay “forward-looking” into Europe and North America.</p>
<h2><strong>The US dollar sell-off pauses for breath in Asia</strong></h2>
<p>The belated charge by currency markets out of defensive US dollar positioning, and into more risk-seeking homes continued overnight. The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/us-dollar-index"" id=""5fc34caae8511"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8827"">Dollar Index</a></span> of developed currencies fell by 0.53% to 97.82. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/eur-usd"" id=""5fc34caae8623"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""1"">EUR/USD</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/gbp-usd"" id=""5fc34caae8726"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""2"">GBP/USD</a></span> consolidated their recent gains although <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-jpy"" id=""5fc34caae884a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""3"">USD/JPY</a></span> remained anchored around 108.00. US dollar outflows being balanced by JPY outflows from Japan investors.</p>
<p>The real stars of the overnight session continue to be the commonwealth commodity-based Australian, Canadian and New Zealand Dollars. With their high beta to China and world trade, all three rallied impressively overnight and look set for more gains in the short-term. The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/aud-usd"" id=""5fc34caae8982"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""5"">AUD/USD</a></span> rose 1.95% to 0.6800 and now targets 0.6930. The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/nzd-usd"" id=""5fc34caae8a85"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8"">NZD/USD</a></span> rose 1.40% to 0.6295 overnight, and this morning is currently testing its 200-day moving average (DMA), at 0.6320. A close above here today signals more gains ahead for the Kiwi. The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-cad"" id=""5fc34caae8b93"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""7"">USD/CAD</a></span> fell 1.45% to 1.3570, falling through its 100-DMA at 1.3725 in the process. USD/CAD’s next target is now its 200-DMA at 1.3460.</p>
<p>Overall, despite pausing for breath in Asia, the rotation out of US dollars is set to continue. The euro, commodity and Asian emerging currencies are all set to outperform into the second half of the week.</p>
<h2><strong>Oil consolidates aa markets await OPEC+ meeting</strong></h2>
<p>The OPEC+ grouping is likely to meet on June 4th, although there is no official confirmation as yet. The behind-the-scenes gossip appears to imply that both Russia and Saudi Arabia are content to extend the production cuts for a few months more. Oil markets though, have been burned before on the bonfire of Saudi/Russian relations, and appear to prefer to wait for official confirmation. US oil must also negotiate the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/api-weekly-crude-oil-stock-656"" id=""5fc34caae9e8a"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""656"">API</a></span> and official US <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/crude-oil-inventories-75"" id=""5fc34caae9fbc"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""75"">Crude Inventory</a></span> data today and tomorrow.</p>
<p>The week’s event risk has taken the heat out of the oil rally for now, although both <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/brent-oil"" id=""5fc34caae8ca0"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8833"">Brent crude</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc34caae8da5"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">WTI</a></span> remain consolidative, rather than retreating. Brent crude climbed 1.70% overnight to $38.35 a barrel, with WTI unchanged on the day at $35.40 a barrel. Prices have crept cautiously higher in Asia today, boosted by a positive equity market performance and no headline surprises from Beijing or Washington DC. Brent has risen to $38.70 a barrel, and WTI has climbed to $38.60 a barrel.</p>
<p>Assuming that oil successfully navigates the OPEC+ meeting and the egos of Washington DC and Beijing, both contracts should be able to continue their recent climb. Notably, a close above $40.00 a barrel on Brent crude, sets up a potential rally to $45.00 initially, to close the considerable price gap on the daily charts.</p>
<h2><strong>Gold grinds higher but lacks momentum</strong></h2>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc34caae8eaf"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">Gold</a></span> continued to grind higher, boosted overnight by a generally weaker US dollar, and residual shorter-term concerns over US-China trade relations. Gold rose by 0.60% to $1740.00 an ounce, although it has retreated slightly to $1737.00 an ounce in Asian trade, as equities rise across the region.</p>
<p>Having been burnt so severely buying into the break of resistance at $1750.00 an ounce previously, traders are unlikely to show the same enthusiasm this time, should gold rise above that level. We also note that gold faces formidable resistance still in the $1800.00 area. Gold’s rally most likely reflects the weakness in the US dollar and not a sea change in its near-term structural outlook. Gold will probably continue higher, but at a glacial pace, and caution should be exercised above $1750.00 an ounce, lest another bull-trap spring shut.</p>

Saudi Arabia has since confirmed that it is back up to full production levels as of yesterday.Meanwhile, a recent Reuters survey suggests that OPEC output hit an eight-year low in September. Speculative investors were net buyers of the commodity in the week to September 24, the latest data snapshot from CFTC shows. <strong>NATURAL GAS</strong> prices have been sliding for the past four sessions, with the commodity reaching the lowest level since August 30 yesterday. The commodity closed below the 55-day moving average at 2.319 on Monday, the first time since August 28. Surging US production and a slackening in demand triggered by expectations for milder weather in the US Mid-west and East in the near future are keeping a lid on prices.The supply/demand mismatch is seeing gas stockpiles increasing, with the latest data from EIA as at September 20 showing an increase of 102 billion cubic feet (bcf). That’s the biggest weekly addition to inventories in 14 weeks. Forecasts for this week’s release due tomorrow show expectations of another 86bcf addition.Speculative accounts turned net sellers of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/natural-gas"" id=""5fc34a44c9769"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8862"">natural gas</a></span> for the first time in six weeks, according to the latest data as at September 24 from CFTC.</p>

<p><strong>GOLD</strong> was given a bit of a reprieve yesterday as the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/us-dollar-index"" id=""5fc34a44c9820"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8827"">US dollar</a></span> retreated and investors searched for safe haven assets after a disappointing US <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/ism-manufacturing-pmi-173"" id=""5fc34a44ca050"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""173"">ISM manufacturing PMI</a></span> print for September. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc34a44c98ca"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">Gold</a></span> had touched the weakest in almost two months before rebounding, but still looks to be capped by the 55-day moving average at 1,490. That moving average had acted as a support for prices from end-May until last Monday. September was a bad month for gold as it fell 3.1%, bringing a four month rally to a halt.</p>
<p>Speculative investors remain bullish on the yellow metal however, boosting net long positions to the most since July 2016, according to the latest data from CFTC. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) added to their gold holdings for an 11th consecutive day, Bloomberg reported yesterday. Russia’s finance ministry said yesterday that the country’s gold production rose 10.5% in the first six months of 2019 from a year earlier, hitting 135.33 tonnes.</p>

Palladium has fallen for the past three days and the nearest possible support point could be the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the August-September rally at 1,626.70.</p>
<p>Speculative investors were well positioned for the move to record highs, having boosted net long positions for a fourth week to September 24, taking them to the highest in eight weeks.</p>

<p>The weak US manufacturing PMI data pressured<strong> COPPER</strong> prices to the lowest in almost a month yesterday. The industrial metal is slightly higher today, hoping to snap the two-day losing streak.

News that China is offering tariff waivers on some US imports together with lower US stockpiles and the prospect of tighter supply going forward are giving prices a lift. Wet weather in the US Mid-west is threatening to delay the US harvest.</p>
<p>Soybeans hit the highest level since July 15 yesterday, though the 55-day moving average at 8.671 looks poised to cross below the 100-day moving average at 8.666, which is often interpreted as a medium-term bearish signal.</p>

<p>Why? Because the Trump administration has decided to withhold from the public a key component of the agreement that lists specifics of what and when China will buy in terms of U.S. agriculture.</p>
<p>Releasing details of such purchase specifics could influence market behavior, argued U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin in a joint statement issued Tuesday.</p>
<p></p><h2 dir=""ltr"">Other Than Dollar Value, Little Clue For Grains Traders</h2>
<p>What this basically means is that the 86-page document to be released after Wednesday’s signing will not tell traders how to exactly position their bets on soybeans and corn, in anticipation of China’s purchases of the two U.S. grains for animal feed and other uses. <br><br>What’s more, caution may be necessary on the part of traders, because Messrs Lighthizer and Mnuchin said on Tuesday <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/news/stock-market-news/us-to-maintain-tariffs-on-chinese-goods-until-phase-2-deal-mnuchin-2059574"" id=""5fc34c30d65f4"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""oal"" data-articleid=""2059574"">that none</a></span> of the U.S. duties applied on Chinese goods over the past 18 months will be removed despite the deal. The tariffed amount stands at more than $360 billion.<br><br>This basically means that aside from the dollar value printed on the document for purchases, it is pretty much up to China to decide how it wishes to proceed with its U.S. farm buys.</p>
<p>While there may be a deal that officials on both sides are privy to, the traders would have no advance knowledge of the details until they see the numbers reflected in belated data released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture — or get them leaked by sources in the right places.</p>
<h2 dir=""ltr"">Even With Deal, Trade War Not Over</h2><p></p>
<p>Even more important, traders have to beware that for all intent and purposes, the trade war is far from over — proving precisely what Taoran Notes, a blog linked to China’s state-run Economic Daily newspaper,  said.</p>
<p>Beijing has described the Phase One as “just the first round of a game” through that social media account, </p>
<p>“We must bear in mind that the trade war is not over yet – the U.S. hasn’t revoked all its tariffs on China, and China is still implementing its retaliatory measures,” said the Taoran Notes, which is used by the Chinese government to manage trade talk expectations. “There are still many uncertainties down the road.”</p>
<p>Phillip Streible, chief markets strategist at Blue Line Futures in Chicago, concurs. “Reports that Chinese tariffs are to stay on until after the U.S. election despite a trade deal, would merit further caution” on the part of traders.</p>
<p></p><h2 dir=""ltr"">Buyers Beware</h2>
<p>Both U.S. and Chinese officials agree that to make the Phase One work, a Phase Two is integral. But reaching consensus on what is likely to be an even more vexatious round of talks seems daunting to each side, with President Donald Trump even suggesting that it be put off till after the presidential election in November.<br><br>So, back to the question of where this leaves soybeans and corn — as well as wheat, which, however, isn’t a major Chinese import.<br><br>Some analysts say U.S. grain prices have trended flat or higher since the start of this year in anticipation of better demand from China after the Phase One deal.<br><br></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img title=""U.S. Soybeans Futures Weekly Prices"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pice2b4d6e0a4c0a2dbeb926cb05057fe86.png"" alt=""U.S. Soybeans Futures Weekly Prices""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">U.S. Soybeans Futures Weekly Prices</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr"">Some Still See Phase One As Catalyst For A Grains Rally</h2><p></p>
<p>“The trade agreement is a likely catalyst and could have big implications for corn,” said Eric Scoles, commodities strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago.  </p>
<p></p><p>He said the bigger factor driving corn now was demand. “If the U.S.-China trade deal moves forward there is huge potential for increased demand for corn; whether it’s for livestock feed, human consumption or production of ethanol.”<br><br></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img title=""U.S. Corn Futures Weekly Prices"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic05d881a0cf47bfe8f2a699bede9775be.png"" alt=""U.S. Corn Futures Weekly Prices""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">U.S. Corn Futures Weekly Prices</span></div></div></div><p></p><p></p>

</ul><p>On Friday, Oct. 9, the US Department of Agriculture released its monthly World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report.

The latest WASDE report supported recent gains.</p>
<p>The WASDE spells out changes in crop yields, stockpiles, imports and exports, and consumer demand in the volatile agricultural sector. The weather conditions in the leading growing areas determine supplies each year and can be extremely variable.</p>
<p>A derecho in mid-August weighed on supplies and caused prices to rise. Meanwhile, the demand side of the fundamental equation is ever-increasing. According to the US Census Bureau, each quarter the world adds approximately twenty million people. At the turn of this century, six billion people inhabited the earth. At the end of last week, that number was over 28% higher at 7.69 billion. Each day there are more mouths to feed, meaning that the world must produce more of the agricultural products required for nutrition.</p>
<p>Since 2012, plentiful crops of grains and other agricultural commodities have been sufficient to meet requirements. Because the world will require more products in 2021 than in 2020, and the weather will determine production, we could see lots of price variance and higher prices in agricultural futures markets in the coming months and years. Time will tell if the rally that began over the past months is the start of the significant bullish trend in agricultural commodity prices.</p><h2><strong>Soybeans rise above a level of technical resistance</strong></h2><p>As the 2020 harvest continues, the price of nearby&nbsp;soybeans futures rose above its level of technical resistance.</p>

<p>The price of pork fell to the lowest price since 2002 and has recovered. While the global pandemic and issues with the supply chain caused beef and pork prices to move to multi-year lows earlier in 2020, both have recovered. Elevated grain prices increase feed prices for animal protein producers and are a bullish factor for the meats. <span style=""display: none;"">ihher higher </span></p>
<p><span style=""display: none;"">&nbsp;</span></p><h2><strong>Mother Nature could throw the commodities that feed the world a curveball in 2021</strong></h2><p>Soybeans, corn and wheat prices have all moved into bullish trends over the past months. Soybeans and wheat rose to multi-year highs, while corn is flirting with the $4 level.</p>
<p>The focus will now shift to the 2020/2021 crop year below the equator. However, since the world’s leading producers of the grains and oilseed are in the northern hemisphere, the weather and demand in the planting, growing and harvest seasons in 2021 will determine if a bull market in the grain sector continues.</p>
<p>The last time the markets experienced a significant supply issue was during the 2012 drought, which pushed the prices of corn and soybeans to all-time highs at $8.4375 and $17.9475 per bushel, respectively. In 2012, wheat rose to a high of $9.4725. Even though the grains have experienced significant rallies, there is a lot of room for increased prices.</p>
<p>According to the US Census Bureau, each quarter, the global population increases by approximately twenty million people. Over eight years, that amounts to 640 million more mouths to fill with nutritional requirements. Any supply issues could send prices to higher levels than during the last bull market that took prices to highs in 2012.</p>
<p>Mother Nature determines the weather. She will be the ultimate arbiter of the path of least resistance of grain prices in 2021. Time will tell if the recent rally is just the start of a bull market in the grain sector.</p>

<p>A Biden win may drive a rush for companies to implement decarbonization strategies, spurring investment in green/renewable energy. With economic activity globally beginning to see a resurgence and continued low commodity prices, it has allowed companies to run through a process and determine if executing a deal now would lead to greater value down the road.</p>
<p>This particularly is true in U.S. shale where operators can be more nimble and adjust product to meet demand. A year from now expect a lot fewer players in the U.S. oil field. This is because of bankruptcies will likely continue, poor trade deals and higher taxes. Not a game winning formula.

<p><strong>Fundamentals Still Supportive</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>When you start pulling all of these facts together, I find it very hard not to be bullish on the equity market. Over the past few days, my view of the equity market has gotten more bullish. I am beginning to believe that we will indeed have a powerful move higher later this year. It may also be the start of the next surge higher in equity prices. Something similar to what we saw in late 2016 through the beginning of 2018. </p><div class=""outerEleWrapper"">
	<div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic3f50362f2c5e9b694b91692511f7d9af.png"" alt=""US 10 Yr Treasury Yield - SP 500 Dividend Yield"" title=""US 10 Yr Treasury Yield - SP 500 Dividend Yield""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">US 10 Yr Treasury Yield - SP 500 Dividend Yield</span></div></div></div><div class=""imageTitles"">
		<span></span>
		<span></span>
	</div>
</div><p>For the first time since the beginning of August, the S&amp;P 500 dividend yield is below that of the 10-Year US treasury. As I have pointed out before these inversions have only occurred on a handful of occasions. Each time it was followed by a massive move higher in equity prices.</p><div class=""outerEleWrapper"">
	<div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picca58937412543096b1cbebfd973e46b0.png"" alt=""S&amp;P 500 Price"" title=""S&amp;P 500 Price""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">S&amp;P 500 Price</span></div></div></div><div class=""imageTitles"">
		<span></span>
		<span></span>
	</div>
</div><p>Also, just like during past times, the S&amp;P 500 was in a period of sideways consolidation during the inversions. This time has proven no different. Each time the spread between the S&amp;P 500 dividend yield and the 10-year yield began to widen, and return to normal, the S&amp;P 500 broke out and went on a bull run higher.</p>
<p><strong>Not Overvalued</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>At this point, the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/us-spx-500"" id=""5fc349da9d5b4"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""166"">S&amp;P 500</a></span> isn’t overvalued either, so the case for the markets rising seems fair. Based on data from S&amp;P Dow Jones, the S&amp;P 500 is trading at roughly 16.6 times 2020 earnings estimates for $181.11 per share. Again, this hardly is expensive when considering earnings growth in 2020 is forecast to be around 12.1% over 2019.</p><div class=""outerEleWrapper"">

</div><p>When using my model, I come up with similar numbers with an S&amp;P EPS estimates of $180.03 for 2020, leaving the index trading at roughly 16.7. Additionally, I am modeling earnings of $197.65 for 2021, and growth of about 10% growth over 2020.

    </div>
        <p>Investing.com - U.S. soybean futures tumbled to a six-month low on Friday, as optimism over the outlook for supplies in South America and weak demand for U.S. supplies drove down prices.</p>
<p><br>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc3458b866ec"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">US soybeans</a></span> for May delivery hit $9.4440 a bushel, a level not seen since October 21, before ending at $9.5140, down 2.0 cents, or 0.21%.</p>
<p>On the week, the May soybean contract lost 32.87 cents, or 3.34%, the fifth weekly decline in the past six weeks.</p>
<p>Brazil and Argentina are major soybean exporters and compete with the U.S. for business on the global market. Large South American crop prospects could weigh on demand for U.S. supplies.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture lowered its forecast for domestic soybean stocks at the end of the 2014-15 season on August 31 to 370 million bushels from 385 million bushels.</p>
<p>According to the agency, global soybean ending stocks were expected to total 89.6 million tons, up from 89.5 million tons estimated last month, due to a record crop in Brazil.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc3458b86966"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">US corn</a></span> for May delivery shed 1.0 cent, or 0.26%, on Friday to close at $3.7700 a bushel. Prices touched an intraday low of $3.7420 earlier, the weakest level since April 1.</p>
<p>For the week, the May corn contract slumped 9.37 cents, or 2.42%, the second straight weekly loss.</p>
<p>The USDA said that U.S. corn inventories at the end of the 2014-15 season in August will total 1.827 billion bushels, up from a previous estimate of 1.777 billion bushels.</p>
<p>The agency also projected global ending corn stockpiles at 188.5 million metric tons for the 2014-15 season, up from a previous forecast of 185.28 million tons.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the Chicago Board of Trade, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc3458b86a47"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">US wheat</a></span> for May delivery rose 7.6 cents, or 1.49%, to settle at $5.2640 a bushel on Friday.</p>
<p>Despite Friday's gains, the May wheat contract slumped 7.13 cents, or 1.33%, on the week.</p>
<p>The USDA forecast domestic reserves in the season ending in May at 684 million bushels, down slightly from last month’s forecast of 691 million.</p>
<p>According to the USDA, global ending wheat inventories will total 197.2 million tons, compared to a forecast of 197.71 in March.</p>
<p>In the week ahead, market players will focus on the release of key USDA data, including crop progress and weekly export sales figures.</p>
<p>Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, government figures show. Wheat was fourth, behind hay.</p>

But current two-week weather forecast calls for hot temperatures and rain, which is ideal at this time to move the crop to maturity. Funds activity is picking up and they are back to going short, and before you know it, barring a headline, they will be holding&nbsp; record shorts again.</p>
<p>And I want to remind traders that the weather is in the driver's seat at the moment, while other fundamental factors are in “wait and see mode.” I do anticipate good trading in the Grain Complex at this time. However, the strength of the dollar is hurting US exports versus Argentina, Brazil and Ukraine. This is what the market will absorb before the Aug. 12 Crop Production USDA Supply/Demand data. December corn is currently trading at 332 which is 1 and ¼ of a cent higher. The trading range has been 333 to 330 ¼.</p>

We have seen a slow increase of production after reaching record lows in April, which saw people losing 30 to 40 cents a gallon on every gallon produced. And that’s when we saw plants cutting production, and/or closing if not idling. As we move forward, losses are expected to carry into 2021. In this market producers are focused on demand.

<p>But the anomaly is unlikely to last. U.S. soybeans are trading in an alternate reality as plummeting exports of rival produce from Brazil indicate that the Chicago market may be headed for a train wreck soon.</p>

<p></p><h2 dir=""ltr"">“Strong Sell” Recommendation </h2>
<p>Investing.com’s Daily Technical Outlook, however, calls for a “Strong Sell” on CME soybeans, predicting a near-term of support of $8.69 per bushel — down 15 cents or 1.7% from current levels.</p>
<p>Analysts think that’s a conservative estimate and that the real fall, when it comes, will be a lot greater.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>“Future demand for U.S. soybeans will depend on the price in Brazil and Argentina,” said Jack Scoville, lead analyst for grains at Chicago brokerage Price Futures Group.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Lower prices there will hurt overall demand here — and lower prices are very possible in Brazil.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brazil's exports of soy fell in the first week of February compared to a year ago, according to government data <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/news/commodities-news/brazil-soy-iron-ore-exports-slide-amid-concerns-over-coronavirus-impact-2081094"" id=""5fc34c6205312"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""oal"" data-articleid=""2081094"">quoted</a></span> by Reuters on Monday.</p>
<p>Soy exports declined to 198,600 tonnes per day on average for the first five working days of this month compared to 263,500 tonnes for the same period in 2019, Brazil’s Economy Ministry said, according to Reuters.</p>
<h2 dir=""ltr"">Absence Of Chinese Buying Obvious</h2><p></p>
<p>The ministry did not break down the exports by countries. But the absence of Chinese buying was obvious as they are the largest consumers of Brazilian soy, just like the U.S. product.</p>
<p>""I think the impact will start from the second half of February,"" Jose Augusto de Castro, president of the Foreign Trade Association of Brazil, said regarding when the Chinese slowdown is likely to start impacting export prices pf Brazilian soy. </p>
<p>Castro said his association had been bracing for fallout from the coronavirus crisis, but added that it was difficult to predict the scale and duration of the hit. </p>
<p>""It's still very early,"" he said, referring to the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/news/commodities-news/explainer-companies-consider-force-majeure-as-coronavirus-spreads-2081250"" id=""5fc34c6205ca4"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""oal"" data-articleid=""2081250"">pandemic</a></span> which has killed more than 1,000 people and infected over 43,000 in China, crippling whole cities and industries in the world’s second-largest economy, besides spreading to more than 25 countries.</p>
<p>Roughly 60% of the soybeans produced in the United States are exported, with at least 25% finding their way to China. Even before the coronavirus breakout, those numbers were already under threat as the trade war between the two countries led the Chinese to seek more soy imports from Brazil and Argentina instead.</p>
<p></p><h2 dir=""ltr"">U.S. Soy Prices Held Up By Producers’ Refusal To Sell</h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>Scoville of Price Futures Group has an idea why U.S. soy prices could be up now — producer reluctance to sell into a market where few want to buy.</p><p></p>
<p>“Many U.S. producers have put their soybeans into storage and are not selling,” Scoville said, adding:</p>
<p></p><blockquote>“This has caused basis levels to firm in the country and at the Gulf of Mexico.”</blockquote><p></p>
<p></p><p>Brazil, meanwhile, has been harvesting and yield reports indicate a bumper crop was coming, Scoville said.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>Dry weather in Argentina had caused some stress to soy plantings, but the imminent arrival of rains could also boost the Argentine crop, he said.</p><p></p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

The USDA’s good-to-excellent ratings for the country’s corn and soybean crops fell shy of analyst expectations, falling even further than the expected 2 percentage points each as conditions in the Midwest worsened due to hot and dry weather.</p>
<p>The Reuters article indicated that corn underwent the biggest decline, with just 64% of the crop rated good to excellent, a 5-percentage point fall from last week and 3% lower than analyst expectations. Advisory service Pro Farmer recently projected that U.S. corn and soybean harvests will fall below the U.S. government’s forecasts, with a corn crop of 14.820 billion bushels and a soybean crop of 4.362 billion bushels, as indicated by Reuters.</p>
<p>Overall, ""U.S. storm damage and Chinese demand are supporting corn prices,"" said Phin Ziebell, an agribusiness economist at National Australia Bank (OTC:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/national-australia-bank-ltd"" id=""5fc353a26b7b8"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""942065"">NABZY</a></span>) in Melbourne, as quoted on agriculture.com. On the other hand, <a href=""https://www.agriculture.com/markets/newswire/grains-corn-soybeans-rise-on-expectations-of-lower-us-output"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">wheat has been extending gains</a> on weather concerns in Argentina.""Notably, Argentina is a key global wheat exporter.</p>
<p><strong>Will the Rally Last?</strong></p>
<p>“Lower demand for ethanol will limit the upside potential,” said the agribusiness economist at National Australia Bank. On the other hand, China's demand for corn to feed animals has risen “as its pig herd has <a href=""https://www.agweb.com/article/china-facing-high-corn-prices-buys-more-us"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">rebounded more quickly</a> than expected from a deadly swine disease.”</p>
<p>Hence, Chinese buyers clinched deals to buy 195,000 tons of American corn, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said lately, as China has been struggling with soaring domestic prices. Larger imports from the United States will also help China to meet the pledge to buy more U.S. farm products as part of a Phase 1 trade deal signed in January. In short, demand for U.S. corn will remain high amid strong export activity.</p>
<p>However, the greenback has been rising lately, which will act as a dampener for broad-based commodity trading. <strong>Invesco DB <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/us-dollar-index"" id=""5fc353a26ba43"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8827"">US Dollar Index</a></span> Bullish Fund</strong> (UUP) has gained 0.3% past week. The Fed’s reluctance to control the yield curve, vaccine hopes and some moderately upbeat U.S. economic indicators contributed to the greenback strength. If the U.S. currency continues to rise, the price of commodities are likely to fall as these are priced in U.S. dollar.</p>
<p><strong>ETFs in Focus </strong></p>
<p>Against this backdrop, investors can bet on the above-said agricultural ETFs as long as the trend is a friend.</p>

<p><strong>CRUDE OIL</strong> prices look set to advance for a third week as OPEC nears agreement to keep current production cuts in place for an extra nine months, taking the current agreement into 2020.

<p>With current cuts in place, the latest Bloomberg survey of analysts predicts that OPEC output fell to 30 million barrels per day (bpd) in June, a drop of 130,000 bpd from May. The reduced production is taking its toll on the Saudi economy, with economic growth reaching just 1.7% y/y in the first quarter, a significant drop from the 3.6% recorded in Q4 2018, with growth in the oil sector slumping to just 1% compared with 6% in Q4.</p>

<p>Bullish bets by speculative accounts were at the highest since September 2017, the latest data from <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-gold-speculative-net-positions-1618"" id=""5fc347ef09b74"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1618"">CFTC</a></span> as at June 25 show, though the recent retracement could see some speculators rushing to trim long positions in next week’s data.</p>
<p><strong>SILVER</strong> has been on a downward slide since June 21 and looks poised to test 100-day moving average support at 15.10. This average has supported prices on a closing basis for the past two weeks. It’s now at 15.174.</p>
<p>Net-long positions held by speculative accounts were boosted to the highest since the week of March 5 in the latest reporting week from <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-silver-speculative-net-positions-1621"" id=""5fc347ef09c28"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1621"">CFTC</a></span>, while Bloomberg reported yesterday that exchange-traded funds added 3.45 million ounces of silver to their holdings in the last trading session. That was the biggest daily increase in holdings since November last year.</p>
<p><strong>PLATINUM</strong> reached the highest in 6-1/2 weeks yesterday but then succumbed to a firmer US dollar and profit-taking. The 100-day moving average resistance remains intact on a closing basis, as it has been since May 16. The 200-day moving average at 830.41 could act as an interim support level.</p>
<p>Speculative investors turned net buyers for the first time in eight weeks, the latest data to June 25 show, but net long positions are still near the lowest in four months.</p>
<p>Speculative accounts increased their net long <strong>PALLADIUM</strong> positions for a sixth consecutive week to June 25, according to CFTC data, and they are now at the highest since the week of March 26. Palladium jumped the most since OANDA began tracking prices in 2005 last month, and is currently hovering just below Friday’s high of 1,568, which in turn was a three-month high.</p>
<h3><strong>Base metals</strong></h3>
<p><strong>COPPER</strong> climbed to a 6-1/2 week high yesterday in a knee-jerk reaction to the trade truce announcement, but gave back those gains, and more, into the close to finish in the red for the second consecutive day.

<p>The mine strike in Chile that had capped production for a couple of weeks ended last Friday as workers accepted a wage deal.

<p><strong>WHEAT</strong> has started the second half of the year negatively and could face the first down month in three months. This retracement could force some scaling back of net long positions by speculative investors, who had built up net long positions to the largest since October 2018, according to the latest data from <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-wheat-speculative-net-positions-1812"" id=""5fc347ef0a083"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1812"">CFTC</a></span> to June 25.</p>
<p>Prolonged droughts in wheat-growing areas has forced Australia to import wheat for the first time since 2007. Lower production has cut exports and supply, with 2018 exports amounting to A$4.1 billion, a 33% drop from 2017 levels.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reported that Rabobank has estimated that Australia’s will produce only 18 million tonnes of wheat next year. Meanwhile, Russia’s grain agency has estimated that Russia’s wheat exports are down 14% so far this season, according to a report from June 25.</p>

<p><strong>SUGAR</strong> rose for the first time in four months in June but is struggling to maintain that momentum into this month. India’s 2019/20 sugar output is seen falling 14% to 28.2 million tons, according to estimates from the Indian Sugar Mills Association. Last week Indonesia announced a cut in import duties to 5% from 10% on sugar imports from India.</p>
<p><strong>SOYBEANS</strong> have been drifting lower over the past two weeks and failed to benefit from the trade truce news. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc347ef09373"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">Soybeans</a></span> are now at 8.848, the lowest since June 14.

C.D.T. from the National Hurricane Center, winds, and water levels along the northern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula will gradually subside this evening. Heavy rainfall, which could lead to significant flash flooding will affect the Yucatan Peninsula through early Thursday. Hurricane Delta is expected to grow as it approaches the northern Gulf Coast, where life-threatening storm surge and dangerous hurricane-forced winds are likely to begin tomorrow, particularly for portions of the Louisiana Coast. Storm and Hurricane watches are in effect, and residents should follow advice given by local officials. Flash urban, small stream and moderate river flooding is likely Friday and Saturday from portions of the central Gulf Coast into portions of the Lower Mississippi Valley. As Delta moves inland, additional heavy rainfall is expected in the Ohio Valley and Mid Atlantic this weekend.</div>

The current weather should be conducive for harvesting, but barge traffic and navigation on the Illinois River and the Mighty Mississippi may hinder product getting to their destination. More dry temperatures are expected in the Corn Belt; however, Hurricane Delta could slow the eastern portions with heavy rains.

        <p>Investing.com - U.S. soybean futures declined on Wednesday to trade near a one-week low amid receding concerns over Brazilian export prospects, as a two-week strike by Brazilian truck drivers appeared to be coming to an end.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc344c4e3132"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">US soybeans</a></span> for May delivery shed 6.88 cents, or 0.68%, to trade at $10.0613 a bushel during U.S. morning hours.</p>

    </div>
        <p>Investing.com - U.S. wheat futures fell to a fresh four-week low on Wednesday, after agricultural meteorologists forecast further rains in key U.S. wheat-growing states.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc345b085482"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">US wheat</a></span> for May delivery hit a session low of $4.9500 a bushel, the weakest level since March 16, before trading at $4.9825 during U.S. morning hours, up 1.25 cents, or 0.25%.</p>
<p>A day earlier, wheat lost 5.2 cents, or 1.05%, to settle at $4.9700, as updated weather models forecast much-needed rains in key U.S. wheat-growing states.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture said Monday that the U.S. winter wheat crop was rated 42% good to excellent as of April 12, down from 44% in the preceding week.</p>
<p>Approximately 34% of the crop was in good to excellent condition in the same week a year earlier.</p>
<p>The agency also said that 17% of the spring wheat crop was planted as of last week, compared to just 5% in the same week a year earlier and below the five-year average of 11% for this time of year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc345b0858fb"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">US corn</a></span> for May delivery slumped 2.02 cents, or 0.54%, to trade at $3.7138 a bushel. On Tuesday, corn hit $3.7000, a level not seen since March 18, before closing at $3.7340, up 3.0 cents, or 0.81%.</p>
<p>Prices remained supported amid concerns over wet weather delaying planting in the U.S. grain belt. According to the USDA, 2% of the corn crop was planted as of last week. The five-year average for this time of year is 5%.</p>
<p>Indications of ample global supplies have weighed on futures in recent sessions. The USDA said last week that U.S. corn inventories at the end of the 2014-15 season in August will total 1.827 billion bushels, up from a previous estimate of 1.777 billion bushels.</p>
<p>The agency also projected global ending corn stockpiles at 188.5 million metric tons for the 2014-15 season, up from a previous forecast of 185.28 million tons.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the Chicago Board of Trade, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc345b085a43"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">US soybeans</a></span> for May delivery eased up 2.65 cents, or 0.28%, to trade at $9.6325 a bushel. Soybean prices climbed 11.4 cents, or 1.21%, on Tuesday to end at $9.6020.</p>
<p>Prices of the oilseed touched a six-month low of $9.4440 on April 10 as optimism over the outlook for supplies in South America and weak demand for U.S. supplies drove down prices.</p>
<p>Last week, the USDA forecast global soybean ending stocks at 89.6 million tons, up from 89.5 million tons estimated last month, due to a record crop in Brazil.</p>
<p>Brazil and Argentina are major soybean exporters and compete with the U.S. for business on the global market. Large South American crop prospects could weigh on demand for U.S. supplies.</p>
<p>Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, government figures show. Wheat was fourth, behind hay.</p>

        <p></p><p>(Bloomberg) -- <span itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Corporation""><span itemprop=""name""> Marubeni Corp. </span></span>, one of the world’s biggest general trading companies, said its U.S.-based unit Columbia Grain Trading Inc., stopped all new sales of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34fe4b43db"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span> to Chinese customers, according to a statement.</p><p></p>
<p>The decision was due to worsening profitability and uncertainties about trade conditions, the company said by email, without elaborating. Gavilon Group, another U.S. trader owned by the Japanese conglomerate, will continue trading soybeans to China without any changes, it said.</p>
<p>Agricultural commodity firms have struggled to make money after years of bumper harvests and low prices curbed the volatility traders need to thrive. Their plight has worsened as U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping make slow progress in negotiations to ease their trade war. Marubeni said earlier this year that a decline in trading volumes and prices fueled by the spat had hurt its agricultural business.</p>
<p></p><p>Other companies are also under pressure. Cargill Inc. is looking to shake up its business as Trump’s trade war makes it harder to navigate unpredictable crop markets. Earlier this month, Cargill reported its steepest quarterly profit decline in four years as it dealt with tumult ranging from trade disputes to inclement weather in the U.S. Midwest and lower feed demand in China due to the spread of African swine fever.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>Marubeni (T:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/marubeni-corp."" id=""5fc34fe4b4640"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""44222"">8002</a></span>) shares in Tokyo declined 1.2% to 714.3 yen at Friday’s close, outpacing a drop in Japan’s benchmark <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/topix"" id=""5fc34fe4b5516"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""41042"">Topix index</a></span>, which fell 0.4%. The company’s shares have lost over 17% in the past year.</p><p></p>
<p>Sales Slump</p>
<p>Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. is also undergoing a transformation to focus more on animal nutrition and to cut costs. Bunge Ltd. is looking to offload some business, recently announcing a joint venture with British oil major BP Plc.</p>
<p>Marubeni’s Columbia Grain Trading was formerly one of the biggest trading houses in China’s imported soybean market, the company said. The unit is engaged in trading soybeans, corn, sorghum and other grains mainly from the Americas to China, Japan and Southeast Asia, according to a company website.</p>
<p>China, the world’s top soybean buyer, purchased about 14 million tons of American soybeans since December, when Washington and Beijing first reached a truce in the tit-for-tat trade spat. That’s still down from the usual 30 million to 35 million tons of American supplies China usually buys a year.</p>    <div class=""clear""></div>"

<p></p>
<h3><strong>Precious metals</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p><strong>GOLD</strong> is back below the $1,400 handle again after the strong nonfarm payroll data on Friday suggested the US economy might be doing just fine. The firmer US dollar on the back of higher yields hurt sentiment for <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc34855b8c07"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">gold</a></span>, and the metal looks poised for its fourth daily drop in a row today.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Central banks continue to buy gold with the Peoples Bank of China revealing yesterday that it had increased its gold reserves for a seventh straight month in June, adding 10.3 million tons in the month. Poland had also said last week that it had more than doubled its gold reserves between 2018 and 2019. India hiked the import duty on gold to 12.5% from 10% in its 2019 budget last week.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Speculative investors increased net-long positions for a fifth week to July 2, according to the latest <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-gold-speculative-net-positions-1618"" id=""5fc34855b96ca"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1618"">CFTC</a></span> data, driving them to the highest since September 2016.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>SILVER</strong> remains unfavoured versus gold, and is facing the prospect of a close below the 200-day moving average at 15.0039 for the first time since June 17. Speculative investors have turned net <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-silver-speculative-net-positions-1621"" id=""5fc34855b97b5"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1621"">bearish</a></span> in their positioning for the first time in five weeks, data to July 2 show. However, as at last Friday, physical <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/silver"" id=""5fc34855b8f20"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8836"">silver</a></span> holdings with exchange-traded funds were at the highest since November last year.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As mentioned above, silver is flirting with the 200-day moving average, with the 55-day moving average at 14.88 the next possible support point below. The gold/silver (Mint) ratio is hovering near record highs struck earlier this month.</p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>PLATINUM</strong> holdings with exchange-traded funds increased by about 61,000 tons last week, according to a Bloomberg report, while speculative accounts increased their net long positions for a second week to July 2, and they are now at the highest since May 21, the latest data snapshot from CFTC shows.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Platinum is now at 809.62 as the 55-day moving average at 829.15 traded below the 200-day moving average at 830.39 yesterday for the first time since March 25. This crossover is often interpreted as a medium term bearish signal.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>PALLADIUM</strong> looks poised to extend the decline from 3-1/2 month highs to a second day today as it plays victim to a resurgent US dollar. Speculative investors appeared to be correctly positioned for the last run higher, having been net buyers for a sixth straight week to July 2. Investors are most bullish on palladium since the week of March 26. Exchange-traded funds trimmed their physical <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/palladium"" id=""5fc34855b9034"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8883"">palladium</a></span> holdings by 8,600 troy ounces last week, Bloomberg reported.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Base metals</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p><strong>COPPER</strong> posted the biggest weekly drop since May last week, snapping a three-week winning streak, and the decline seems to be extending into this week. With the global demand outlook uncertain, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/copper"" id=""5fc34855b913d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8831"">copper</a></span> stocks at warehouses tracked by the London Metal Exchange were at the highest since June 2018 last Friday, while China reported that its output had increased by 15% to 728,300 tons in June from a month earlier.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Speculative investors remain bearish, increasing net short positions for a second straight week in the week to July 2, latest <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-copper-speculative-net-positions-1620"" id=""5fc34855b98a6"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1620"">CFTC</a></span> data show. Copper is edging toward the 200-week moving average support at 2.6238, which has held on a closing basis since September last year.</p>

<h3><strong>Energy</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p><strong>CRUDE OIL</strong> is struggling to maintain last month’s gains, despite the extension of production cuts into 2020 by OPEC and its allies, as the demand outlook remains uncertain. A smaller-than-expected drawdown of US stockpiles last week is also adding to supply pressures, though Middle East tensions could offer some support to <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-crude-oil-speculative-net-positions-1653"" id=""5fc34855b9996"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1653"">prices</a></span>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Russia’s Energy Minister has calculated that the extension to the OPEC+ deal to next year would deliver about 3.5 trillion rubles ($54.6 billion) to the 2019/20 budget.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>NATURAL GAS</strong> posted the biggest one-day gain since January 14 on Friday after the latest weather forecasts were released. Heatwave temperatures are expected across the US for the July 13-17 period and this prompted buying of the commodity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Weekly gas stockpiles data to July 5 will be released on Thursday, and are expected to show an increase of 94 billion cubic meters (bcm), up from 89 bcm the previous week.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Speculative investors trimmed their net short positions for the first time in five weeks in the week to July 2, according to <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-natural-gas-speculative-net-positions-1820"" id=""5fc34855b9a97"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1820"">CFTC</a></span> data. Investors have been net bearish on the commodity since February, though prices have trade in a narrow 2.90-2.45 range since then.</p>

<h3><strong>Agriculturals</strong></h3>

<p><strong>SOYBEANS</strong> continue in consolidation mode after the May-June rally, having fallen for a second consecutive week last week.

<p>Latest US weather patterns are producing some crop-friendly rains in the growing areas, which could improve supply. Speculative accounts turned net bullish on soybeans for the first time since February, CFTC data to July 2 show.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>CORN</strong> looks poised to break a four-day rising streak that took the commodity to the high for this month. Hot and dry US weather had threatened corn crops, which drove the rally but speculative investors had turned net sellers for the first time in nine weeks in the week to July 2, pulling net long positions from a 13 month high.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A US Department of Agriculture (USDA) report published Friday estimated that Brazil’s corn output could rise 25% to a record high 101 million tons in the current season.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>SUGAR</strong> prices have been confined to a relatively tight range for the past two weeks with no particular trend or direction apparent. There is still a hefty global supply glut, which will likely keep a lid on prices in the near future.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To combat <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-sugar-no11"" id=""5fc34855b9360"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8869"">sugar</a></span> overproduction in India, producers in Maharashtra have asked for permission from the central government to convert the sugar surplus to ethanol. Meanwhile, last month the USDA predicted that Nigeria’s sugar imports will increase by 20,000 tons in the 2019-20 season, a 1% increase from the previous one.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Speculative investors’ positioning turned net long for the first time since the week of April 23 as they remained net buyers for the fifth week in a row, according to CFTC data.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Speculative accounts were also net buyers of <strong>WHEAT</strong> for the ninth consecutive week in the latest reporting week. Net longs are now at the highest since September 2018.</p>

        <p></p><p>(Bloomberg) -- Chicago <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc3508d0fd1a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span> prices rose slightly in a muted response to China’s decision to make a small cut in retaliatory tariffs on American imports along with other agricultural commodities.</p><p></p>
<p>Futures edged higher in the aftermath of Beijing’s announcement Thursday that it will halve additional tariffs on some $75 billion of imports later this month. With the earlier retaliatory duty remaining in place, it still means U.S. soybeans will be subject to a 27.5% tariff, down from 30% previously.</p>
<p>Chicago soybean prices have been whipsawed in recent weeks as optimism over an initial U.S.-China trade pact was dampened by worries China may not be able to fulfill agricultural purchase pledges. The spread of the coronavirus added to food demand fears.</p>
<p>China’s reduction, effective Feb. 14, will coincide with a cut by Washington to tariffs on some Chinese products. Both nations have said they will scale back duties on each other’s goods as part of the phase-one deal signed last month.</p>
<p>“We don’t see any impact from the tariff cut as the measures are in line with what the U.S. side is doing,” said Li Qiang, head of Shanghai JC Intelligence Co. Chinese buyers are still able to import U.S. soybeans as well as other farm goods because Beijing continues to offer tariff waivers, he said.</p>
<p>Futures for March delivery rose 0.3% to $8.82 1/4 a bushel as of 11:23 a.m. in London. They’ve climbed about 1.1% this week, heading for the first gain since early January.</p>
<p>Beijing will also reduce punitive tariffs on U.S. pork, chicken and beef imports to 30% from 35% and on <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc3508d0ffc4"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">crude oil</a></span> to 2.5% from 5%. U.S. livestock futures are not yet open for trading.</p>
<p>Top soy exporter Brazil is grappling with a logjam as heavy rain hampers soybean harvests and vessel loading. Its farmers are in the midst of collecting a bumper soybean crop that’s kept prices more appealing than U.S. rivals. China was said to have booked about 10 cargoes this week from South America, helping ease concerns it would cancel purchases amid the virus outbreak.</p>    <div class=""clear""></div>"

<p>Over the weekend, almost every major US urban area – responsible for the vast majority of the country’s GDP – looked like a war zone, with protestors clashing with police forces over the state of the country's race relations. There was looting and low-level violence in nearly every major metropolitan area. But equities shrugged off the chaos, rallying to close the opening gap lower as the bullish momentum remained unstoppable.</p>
<p>However, the news from China quickly changed the mood, and equities were firmly lower by 50 basis points into the European open as investors quickly dumped risk assets. China is clearly playing a game of pressure with the US, trying to aggravate a weakened agricultural sector, which had already been devastated by the pandemic and prior trade-war tensions.</p>
<p>The rhetoric between Beijing and DC may overshadow all else this week, as markets have clearly decided to discount all of the bad economic news, as well the unprecedented levels of civil unrest, on the assumption that global economic recovery will resume with a vengeance, aided by ultra-accommodative monetary policy and record fiscal stimulus. Yet the bet on the resumption of global growth depends on the world’s number one and number two economies coming to some sort of trade detente. For now, those prospects look dim as both Trump and Xi play to nationalist impulses at home in order to boost their political standing.</p>
<p>The markets may also be underestimating the risk of a geopolitical mistake. The Chinese may press too hard, on the assumption that Trump is too distracted by domestic problems to respond forcefully to any action on their part. But Donald Trump is the most impulsive president in modern history and any escalation of tensions from Beijing could elicit a much more disproportionate response from DC.</p>
<p>For now, the markets continue to ignore all risks and remain only slightly lower despite the economic dangers ahead. The bulls continue to trade on the “Fed has got our back” assumption, but how long that thesis can last remains to be seen.</p>
<p>In FX meanwhile, risk currencies are unfazed with <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/aud-usd"" id=""5fc34c9964525"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""5"">AUD/USD</a></span> up by more than 1% on the day, while the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/usdollar"" id=""5fc34c996462d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""942611"">greenback</a></span> remains weak across the board. Part of the reason for buck’s weakness, as we noted last week, may be the view that the US is no longer the safe-haven asset it once was. But another factor for the dollar’s weakness may be the simple fact that the currency market does not necessarily believe that the US recovery will the fastest from among the G10.</p>

    </div>
        <p>(Bloomberg) -- Commodity producers are having a summer to remember, for all the wrong reasons.A heatwave across swathes of North America, Europe and Asia, coupled with a worsening drought in some areas, is causing spikes in the prices of anything from wheat to electricity. Cotton plants are stunted in parched Texas fields, French rivers are too warm to effectively cool nuclear reactors and the Russian wheat crop is faltering.</p>
<p>The scorching heat is extracting a heavy human cost – contributing to floods in Japan and Laos and wildfires near Athens. Relief from soaring temperatures, which topped 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) in the Arctic Circle,  may not arrive for at least two weeks.It’s a timely reminder of the vulnerability of global commodity markets to the changing climate, as human activity disrupts the behavior of plants, animals and the march of the seasons. </p>
<p>The heat and lack of rainfall is pummeling crops across Europe as far as the Black Sea. Output in Russia, the world’s top wheat exporter, is set to fall for the first time in six years, while concerns continue to mount about smaller crops in key growers such as France and Germany. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc3478033f45"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">Wheat futures</a></span> for December have jumped almost 10 percent in the past month in Paris, with prices this week reaching the highest since the contract started trading in 2015.</p>
<p> After years of bumper harvests, global output could drop this year for the first time since the 2012 to 2013 growing season. This could have political and social ramifications. Egypt, which relies on subsidized bread to feed its almost 100 million people, is already paying the highest price for its imports in more than three years.</p>
<p>French farmers aren’t the only ones finding the weather too hot to handle. The country’s fleet of nuclear power plants is also suffering.Rivers have become too warm to effectively cool the reactors, and Electricite de France SA (PA:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/edf"" id=""5fc347803438f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""391"">EDF</a></span>) may be forced to cut output later this week at two stations. The hot weather also has forced a German coal-fired plant to curb operations and reduced the availability of some plants in Britain fired by <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/natural-gas"" id=""5fc34780344fe"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8862"">natural gas</a></span>. France gets more than 70 percent of its power from 58 atomic stations and is a net exporter of electricity to neighboring countries. Any reductions in output would potentially boost prices across the continent.</p>
<p>The sultry conditions are also leaving wind turbines virtually at a standstill. In Germany, wind output over the past 10 days has been a third lower than the average for the year so far. Windmills are also becalmed in Spain, Italy, the U.K., Denmark and Sweden. Solar operators are enjoying the weather, but they can’t fill the gap left by wind and demand for natural gas is rising. French and German day-ahead wholesale power is at the highest for the time of year for a decade, while in Britain they’re the most since at least 2009.</p>
<p>Over in Texas, power prices are also jumping due to the heat.  The northern part of the state smashed a 93-year-old daily temperature record last week, sending demand surging as people heeded advice to stay indoors and crank up their air conditioning. Wholesale prices for electricity secured a day in advance reached three-year highs, although they’ve since fallen as temperatures moderated. Temperatures got so high that the National Weather Service was advising north Texas residents to avoid walking their dogs, lest they burn Fido’s paws. But for farmers in the west of the state, the drought was hurting even more than the heat. </p>
<p>The West Texas cotton belt – the world’s most productive area for the crop – is brown, baked, cracked and dusty. The dryness is so bad that close to half of the state’s crop is in poor or very poor condition, U.S. government data show. About 4.5 million acres of the fiber are planted in the region, 60 percent of which depends on rain because it isn’t irrigated. </p>
<p>""I lost everything in the dry land,” said Lloyd Arthur, a fourth-generation farmer in Crosby County. He’s not expecting to harvest anything from about a quarter of the 2,000 acres of cotton he sowed this season.</p>
<p>Ron Harkey, the president and chief executive officer of the world’s largest cotton warehouse in Lubbock, expects to get 1.5 million bales from members of a growers cooperative in the area this year. That’s down from 2.5 million last season. Tighter supplies have helped drive <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-cotton-no.2"" id=""5fc34780345ff"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8851"">cotton</a></span> traded in New York up more than 10 percent this year.</p>

<p>The USDA forecast domestic reserves on March 1 at 1.124 billion bushels, above expectations for 1.143 billion. Last year, wheat stocks stood at 1.057 billion.</p>
<p>The agency predicted 55.367 million acres will be seeded with wheat, down from 56.82 million last year. Analysts had forecast plantings of 55.61 million acres.</p>
<p>Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, government figures show. Wheat was fourth, behind hay.</p>

<p>Yet, in the sea of red drowning the commodities complex, a few flickers of green continue to provide hope for longs. One of them is in sugar.</p>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-sugar-no11"" id=""5fc34c446fe15"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8869"">Raw sugar</a></span> on the ICE (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/intercontintlex"" id=""5fc34c446feec"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""7907"">ICE</a></span>) Futures U.S. was poised for a third week of gains out of four on Friday, after hitting a high in the previous session that fell just short of the two-year peaks struck last week. Assuming there’s no slide on the day, the sweetener could finish the week up 1.5%.</p>
<p></p><h2 dir=""ltr"">Sugar Up Most For Month Since 2018, Oil In Reverse</h2>
<p>But more importantly, with today being the final session of January, raw sugar is also showing a gain of nearly 9% on the month. If it closes again in the positive, it could have the highest monthly gain since October 2018’s astronomical gain of nearly 27%.<br><br></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img title=""Sugar Futures Weekly Prices"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic38bfd08deecc27a592ce9805ae787403.png"" alt=""Sugar Futures Weekly Prices""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Sugar Futures Weekly Prices</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p>Now compare that January gain in sugar with how oil has performed for the month. Oil’s benchmark <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/brent-oil"" id=""5fc34c446ffca"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8833"">Brent crude</a></span> is poised for a loss of more than 12% on month, its deepest slide since November 2018.</p>
<p>And it makes sense to compare sugar with oil because sugar’s most important commercial by-product is ethanol — the biofuel that’s blended with gasoline, or petroleum.</p>
<h2 dir=""ltr"">Sugar Is Just Among A Handful Of Commodities With Monthly Gains</h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>In fact, sugar is one of five leading commodities from a field of 36 that are showing gains for January, Investing.com data shows. The winners other than precious metals <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc34c4470094"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">gold</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/xpd-usd"" id=""5fc34c447015a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""1043108"">palladium</a></span> are <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc34c4470205"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">wheat</a></span>, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-cotton-no.2"" id=""5fc34c44702c8"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8851"">cotton</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-cocoa"" id=""5fc34c4470389"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8894"">cocoa</a></span>.</p><p></p>
<p>Typically, sugar prices track those of oil given their dependence on gasoline for ethanol blending — which is mandated at 10% in the United States.</p>
<p>But since the coronavirus outbreak, sugar has strangely been marching to its own drum-beat, as traders and investors focus almost entirely on a supply squeeze forced by a weak crop out of top producer Brazil.</p>
<p></p><h2 dir=""ltr"">Massive Production Shortage</h2>
<p>“We see sugar prices following through on a rally supported by a massive global production deficit,” said Eric Scoles, commodities strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago, adding:</p>
<blockquote>“This is still a very bullish market and my analysis suggests strong fundamentals are still in place.”</blockquote>
<p>Jack Scoville, vice president and analyst for “soft” commodities that include sugar at Chicago’s Price Futures Group, said Brazil could be forced to produce more sugar and less ethanol due to the current weakness in crude oil prices.“</p>
<p>Reports indicate that little is on offer from India. Thailand might also have less this year due to reduced planted area and erratic rains during the monsoon season.” Scoville said, referring to the two other major growing centers for sugar.</p>
<h2 dir=""ltr"">“Strong Buy”</h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>In Thursday’s session, raw sugar for March delivery on ICE Futures US settled at 14.59 cents per lb after peaking at 14.87 — just short of the two-year high of 14.90 set on Jan. 23.</p><p></p>
<p>Investing.com’s Daily Technical Outlook recommends March sugar as a “Strong Buy”, suggesting a top-end resistance of 15.21 cents for the contract. At Thursday’s settlement, that would give the contract room to move up another six cents or 4%.</p>
<p>That would be a sweet move indeed if realized, given the bleak mood across most of the commodities spectrum now bar sugar.</p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

        <p>Investing.com - U.S. corn futures rose to the highest level in more than a week on Wednesday, after the U.S. Department of Agriculture lowered its outlook for domestic and global supplies.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc344e7e5a79"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">US corn</a></span> for May delivery jumped 5.03 cents, or 1.29%, to trade at $3.9360 a bushel during U.S. morning hours, after hitting an intraday peak of $3.9363, the most since March 2.</p>
<p>The USDA said on Tuesday that U.S. corn inventories at the end of the 2014-15 season in August will total 1.777 billion bushels, down 50 million bushels from a previous estimate of 1.827 billion bushels.</p>
<p>The downgrade reflected increased feed demand from livestock producers and from overseas buyers. U.S. corn export projections were raised to 1.800 billion bushels from 1.750 billion bushels in February.</p>
<p>The agency also projected global ending corn stockpiles at 185.28 million metric tons for the 2014-15 season, down from a previous forecast of 189.64 million tons.</p>
<p>A day earlier, US corn for May delivery shed 0.6 cents, or 0.19%, to end at $3.8800 as a broadly stronger <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/us-dollar-index"" id=""5fc344e7e5eda"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8827"">U.S. dollar</a></span> weighed.</p>
<p>A stronger dollar reduces the appeal of U.S. crops to overseas buyers and makes commodities less attractive as an alternative investment.<br> <br>Meanwhile, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc344e7e5ff3"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">US soybeans</a></span> for May delivery ticked up 6.72 cents, or 0.68%, to trade at $9.9113 a bushel. On Tuesday, US soybeans for May delivery dipped 8.6 cents, or 0.88%, to close at $9.8440 a bushel.</p>
<p>The USDA on Tuesday left its forecast for domestic soybean stocks at the end of the 2014-15 season on August 31 unchanged at 385 million bushels, disappointing expectations for a decline to 376 million bushels.</p>
<p>According to the agency, global soybean ending stocks were expected to total 89.5 million tons, up from 89.26 million tons estimated last month.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the Chicago Board of Trade, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc344e7e60ff"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">US wheat</a></span> for May delivery rose 4.53 cents, or 0.92%, to trade at $4.9813 a bushel. Prices touched $5.0213 earlier, the highest since March 4.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, prices tacked on 3.2 cents, or 0.66%, to close at $4.9320 after the USDA forecast domestic reserves in the season ending in May at 691 million bushels, down slightly from last month’s forecast of 692 million.</p>
<p>The agency left its U.S. wheat export estimate unchanged at 900 million bushels, a five-year low.</p>
<p>According to the USDA, global ending wheat inventories will total 197.71 million tons, compared to a forecast of 197.85 in February.</p>
<p>Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, government figures show. Wheat was fourth, behind hay.</p>

         <p>By Chris Prentice</p> <p>(Reuters) - The White House on Tuesday denied that President Donald Trump planned to issue an executive order to change the national biofuels program, after the U.S. Renewable Fuels Association (RFA) said Trump's team had informed the group an order was pending.</p> <p>Trading in U.S. refinery shares, fuel futures and corn prices was turbulent on the news of the pending order and its subsequent denial, as investors puzzled over what it would mean for the price of gasoline, ethanol and shares of companies that produce them.</p> <p>The RFA issued a statement early on Tuesday that said a member of the Trump administration had called to inform the group the president intended to sign an executive order that would shift the onus on combining biofuels with gasoline away from refiners. The order would require companies further down the supply chain, such as retailers who sell gasoline, to shoulder that load.</p> <p>Refiners have long requested this change, saying the biofuels program has hammered their profits. </p> <p>White House spokeswoman Kelly Love, however, said on Tuesday afternoon ""there is no ethanol executive order in the works.""</p> <p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/ethanol-futures"" id=""5fc3568769f52"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""961732"">Ethanol</a></span> and fuel retail groups reacted quickly to the reports. Trump’s regulation adviser, billionaire investor Carl Icahn, is majority owner of CVR Energy (N:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/cvr-energy-inc"" id=""5fc356876a188"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""20985"">CVI</a></span>), a refining company that would benefit from the change. That stock is up 80 percent since Trump's election in November.</p> <p>Even after the White House denial, RFA Chief Executive Officer Bob Dinneen stuck by his statement, saying there is ""certainly something in the works, but they're not going to confirm it until they are ready to roll with it."" He declined to identify who in the Trump administration contacted the association.</p> <p>""Despite our continued opposition to the move, we were told the executive order was not negotiable,"" Dinneen said.</p> <p>The Renewable Fuel Standard requires fuel companies to use increasing amounts of biofuel blended with gasoline and diesel. Former U.S. President Barack Obama expanded the rules, which started under his predecessor, George W. Bush, when gasoline prices were near records.</p> <p>Refineries without operations designed to blend biofuels such as ethanol into gasoline have to pay for renewable fuel credits, known as RINs, to meet U.S. environmental standards to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The cost for refiners has increased sharply in the last few years; nine major publicly traded refiners paid $2.5 billion in 2016 for RINs costs, a 78 percent increase from 2015. </p> <p>Among those that have pushed for the change is Icahn, who holds an 82 percent stake of CVR. That company's shares jumped on Tuesday before paring gains after the White House denial; they ended up 3.5 percent on the day to $22.92 a share, on heavier-than-usual trading volume of 1.7 million shares. </p> <p>Icahn was unavailable for comment, and CVR declined to comment. </p> <p>Emily Skor, CEO of biofuel trade group Growth Energy, expressed concern about any role Icahn may have played in planning changes to the program.</p> <p>""I assure you this is no deal for anyone but Carl Icahn,"" she said. ""If we had been approached with this deal, we would have flat-out rejected it."" </p> <p>Seven Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, sent a letter to the White House this month, saying Icahn’s role as an adviser to Trump created financial conflicts of interest and called for a review. </p> <p>Shares of U.S. refiner Valero (N:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/valero-energy"" id=""5fc356876a6ab"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8241"">VLO</a></span>), which would also benefit from the changes, ended up 1 percent on Tuesday to close at $67.95 a share. </p> <p>'BACKROOM DEAL'</p> <p>Biofuel organizations and groups representing fuel retailers and integrated oil companies like the U.S. units of Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/royal-dutch-shell-a-shr?cid=6593"" id=""5fc356876a75f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""6593"">RDSa</a></span>) and <span itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Corporation""><span itemprop=""name""> BP </span></span> Plc (L:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/bp"" id=""5fc356876a80b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""284"">BP</a></span>) have opposed the change, which they say will complicate managing the program. </p> <p>One source said the RFA was told the executive order would include incentives for ethanol and biodiesel in a tradeoff for the blending shift.</p> <p>Those changes could include a waiver to allow greater volumes of ethanol to be blended into gasoline in the summer, a review of how the Environmental Protection Agency estimates emission impacts of biofuels, and support for a congressional tax credit for domestic producers of biodiesel, the source said.</p> <p>Chicago Board of Trade corn futures (<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc356876aa3c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">Cc1</a></span>) ended up about 1.7 percent. CBOT soyoil <boc1>, which is used for biodiesel, rose 4.8 percent. </boc1></p> <p></p>
<p>Compliance credits used to meet the annual biofuel blending standards traded around 43 cents on Tuesday from 47 cents to 48 cents previously, paring big morning losses.</p> <p>    </p><div class=""clear""></div>"

<p>Corn is up more than 5% in the three sessions leading to Wednesday, as a bout of technical buying kicked in after futures broke above key moving-averages.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, wheat plunged 10.4 cents, or 1.97%, to settle at $5.2340 after the U.S. Department of Agriculture revealed that winter-wheat crop conditions improved last week.</p>
<p>According to the USDA, Oklahoma winter wheat was rated 44% good to excellent as of last week, up from 40% in the previous week, while Texas winter wheat improved by 4% to 55%.</p>

Hoosier Ag Today reported the recent rains brought needed relief to corn and soybeans, with increasing topsoil and subsoil moisture significantly from last week. Ohio’s Country Journal-Ohio Ag Net reports rain haves and have-nots showing up in their state. This brought an easing of prices in the overnight electronic session.

Lawmakers are aware that they already provided support and the USDA distributed billions in financial aid to other segments in the agriculture sector. Producers from the pork and beef industries, as well as cotton, wheat, asparagus, cilantro and rhubarb have received help, but the ethanol producers have been left out. This damage has come after the feud with the oil industry regarding blending requirements. Let's hope politicians can brush aside politics and pork barreling and get relief to those who need it.

<p>Recent satellite imagery suggest the system does not yet have a well defined center, but data from NOAA buoy 41040 indicate the system is producing winds near tropical-storm-force. An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft is scheduled to investigate later this afternoon. If the storm becomes a Tropical Wave, the name will be Isaias. Based on its current track, it is headed towards the East Coast or possibly the Gulf of Mexico. This has been the ninth Disturbance in the Atlantic so early in hurricane season.

Dry weather in Argentina, Brazil and the Black Sea were supportive. Also, the funds remain net-long and China’s holiday, Golden Week that started last Friday Oct. 1, still had rumors persist that China was buying U.S. corn and soybeans yesterday.</p>
<p>Hot and dry weather in the Corn Belt the rest of the week should ramp up harvest to even better numbers. There is also a story that there may be delays in opening the Illinois River’s, Peoria Lock and Dam to navigation, which could disrupt grain flows according to Allen a.

        <p>Investing.com - U.S. wheat futures rose sharply on Tuesday to hit the highest level in almost four weeks as forecasts showing adverse weather conditions across the U.S. grain belt supported prices.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc3437e0ce8f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">US wheat</a></span> for March delivery hit a session high of $5.4113 a bushel, the most since January 22, before trading at $5.4088 during U.S. morning hours, up 7.67 cents, or 1.44%.</p>
<p>Grain markets were closed on Monday for the Presidents Day holiday. On Friday, US wheat for March delivery tacked on 2.6 cents, or 0.52%, to close at $5.3560 a bushel.</p>
<p>Updated weather forecasting models pointed to frigid weather spanning from the southern Great Plains region to the Northeast through February 19.</p>
<p>Colder-than-normal weather will then linger in the mid-Atlantic states through the Ohio Valley from February 20 until the end of the month, potentially threatening yields and reducing the quality of the harvest.</p>
<p>Despite gains, wheat has been under heavy selling pressure in recent weeks amid ample global supplies and indications of reduced demand for U.S. wheat.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc3437e0d181"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">US soybeans</a></span> for March delivery inched up 6.28 cents, or 0.63%, to trade at $9.9688 a bushel after touching a daily peak of $9.9820, the highest level since February 3.</p>
<p>US soybeans for March delivery rose 5.4 cents, or 0.56%, on Friday to settle at $9.9600 a bushel amid indications of strong demand for U.S. supplies.</p>
<p>U.S. farmers sold 746,200 tons of soybeans last week according to the Department of Agriculture, above expectations.</p>
<p>The U.S. National Oilseed Processors Association is due to release its monthly report later in the day, as investors assess the strength of demand for the oilseed.</p>
<p>Despite recent gains, prices of the oilseed remain vulnerable amid optimism over crop prospects in Brazil and Argentina.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the Chicago Board of Trade, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc3437e0d253"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">US corn</a></span> for March delivery advanced 2.27 cents, or 0.59%, to trade at $3.8988 a bushel. On Friday, US corn for March delivery eased up 0.6 cents, or 0.19%, to end at $3.8800.</p>
<p>Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, government figures show. Wheat was fourth, behind hay.</p>

<p>In yesterday’s action technicians were hoping to print a new high at 416 or 416 ½ but it never happened. The market did stay near or at 415 during most of the trading session and did finally make a new high of 415 ½ and settled at 413 ¾ which was 5 cents higher.

<p>Meanwhile the Venezuelan vessel carrying 1.3 million barrels of crude oil continues to dangerously tilt and could cause a catastrophic oil spill. This could be an ecological disaster, just to give you an idea the vessel named Nabarima cargo is about 5 times of the cargo the famed Exxon Valdez spilled in 1989. Another concern is aquatic life in the Caribbean, and this could be a bigger blow after this active hurricane season that is showing no signs of quit so far. The vessel is part of a joint venture between Petroles de Venezuela (PDVSA) and Italy’s Eni Spa. The vessel has been stranded since January 2019 while an Eni spokesperson said they were waiting from a green light from the U.S. government to prevent any sanction “risks”, trying to offload crude oil from the vessel.

This gave natural gas a reason to pull in the reigns from the rally we have been seeing, and the EIA Gas Storage number gave another reason for profit taking.</p>
<p>The Thomson Reuters poll supplied by Scott DiSavino with 14 analysts participating, estimate increases of 42bcf to 62bcf with the median 52bcf.

<p><strong>Japan's export prowess is a thing of the past. </strong>Net <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/exports-995"" id=""5fc34b02e1ea4"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""995"">exports</a></span> were a drag on Q3 <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/gdp-119"" id=""5fc34b02e23f1"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""119"">GDP</a></span>. The October <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/trade-balance-1005"" id=""5fc34b02e250a"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1005"">trade balance</a></span> is likely to show that there has been little improvement. Japan has recorded an average monthly trade <em>deficit</em> of about JPY157 bln. In the first nine months last year, the average monthly <em>surplus </em>nearly JPY3 bln. In the first nine months of 2017, the average monthly surplus was almost JPY241 bln. In September exports were off 5.2% year-over-year, and imports had fallen by 1.5%.</p>
<p><strong>Japan will also report October <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/national-cpi-1766"" id=""5fc34b02e2622"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1766"">CPI</a></span> and flash November <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/manufacturing-pmi-202"" id=""5fc34b02e2a0c"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""202"">PMI</a></span> on November 21. </strong>Japan's CPI is expected to have stabilized after the headline fell to 0.2% year-over-year in September. The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/national-core-cpi-344"" id=""5fc34b02e2b0d"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""344"">core measure</a></span>, which excludes fresh food, fell to 0.3%. The Q3 GDP deflator (0.6% vs. 0.4% in Q2) suggests Japan that deflation is less a threat than the CPI may have suggested. The flash PMI may be more important, though it has only recently been tracked. A revision in October <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/services-pmi-1912"" id=""5fc34b02e2f47"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1912"">services PMI</a></span> to 49.8 from 49.1 spurred the upward revision to the composite reading to 50.3 from 49.7. Between the sales tax increase and the typhoon, and given the lack of any meaningful momentum for from Q3, the risk is that the Japanese economy contracted as the fourth quarter got underway.</p>
<p><strong>South Korea's trade figures for the first 20-days of November will also shed light on the economic entrails of the region. </strong>Recall the recent trend. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/exports-1316"" id=""5fc34b02e30a1"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1316"">Exports</a></span> were under pressure all year and in August were off 13.6% year-over-year. In September, they fell dramatically and were down 21.8% before stabilizing in October when exports were still 19.5% lower from a year ago. In the first 10-days of November, the preliminary figures suggested they had fallen almost 21% year-over-year. Computers, chips, and autos sectors appear to be at the heart of it.</p>
<p><strong>The People's Bank of China raised the significance of the one-year Loan Prime Rate. </strong>It is set on the 20th of every month. Since it was introduced a few months ago, it has been cut by a measly five basis points to 4.20%. Yes, we added the PBOC to the list of other central banks that eased policy recently, like the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, but not really. The latest string of data and the slowing of lending, which in China's debt-financed growth is critical, warns that economic growth is slowing. </p>
<p><strong>It is easy to talk about a sub-6% pace in Q4, but we should not pretend that the figures are precise or particularly accurate. </strong>In testimony to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress last week, Federal Reserve Chairman Powell cited China's stable <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/gdp-461"" id=""5fc34b02e31d5"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""461"">GDP</a></span> readings as evidence of its management. <strong>The takeaway is that the Chinese economy is slowing, and more stimulus is likely to be delivered. </strong>One form of this stimulus is lower interest rates, and there is an opportunity to deliver toward the end of next week.</p>
<p><strong>The recovery narrative is the weakest in Asia and maybe the strongest in Europe. </strong>First, the EMU reported an unexpected rise in September <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/industrial-production-160"" id=""5fc34b02e36c0"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""160"">industrial output</a></span> (0.1% vs., forecasts for a 0.2% decline). Then Germany surprised with a meager 0.1% <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/german-gdp-131"" id=""5fc34b02e37c4"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""131"">expansion</a></span> in Q3 when nearly everyone had anticipated the second consecutive quarterly contraction. Q2 growth was revised down, which means that although  Germany avoided the simplistic definition of a recession, it still contracted over a six month period. </p>
<p><strong>Nevertheless, the idea is that with low rates, robust lending figures, a <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/eur-usd"" id=""5fc34b02e15c5"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""1"">weak currency</a></span>, and other adjustments, the euro area may be past its low point. </strong>What would help lend credence to this view is a gain in the flash <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/markit-composite-pmi-1491"" id=""5fc34b02e38c0"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1491"">composite PMI</a></span> for November. It would be the second rise in a row, though, in fairness, it is more like stabilizing after taking a step down in September to 50.1 from 51.9 in August. It edged higher to 50.6 in October.</p>
<p><strong>Some economists are concerned that the weakness in the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/manufacturing-pmi-201"" id=""5fc34b02e3d6f"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""201"">manufacturing</a></span> sector is bleeding into <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/services-pmi-272"" id=""5fc34b02e4206"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""272"">services</a></span>. </strong>Ideally, the PMI will show that both sectors improved, almost as if the residual strength of the domestic economy (services) was helping underpin the manufacturing.</p>
<p><strong>The eurozone will also report new auto registrations for October, which is a proxy for auto sales. They have not been doing particularly well this year. </strong>Through September, they have posted an average monthly decline of 0.1% (year-over-year). However, some improvement has been seen of late. New auto registrations rose an average of 2.5% year-over-year in Q3. They finished Q3 with a surge. Still, the early readings for October suggest they have held up well, and an increase of around 7% looks reasonable, based on the preliminary data from Germany, Netherlands, and Austria.</p>
<p><strong>Risks still remain for Europe. </strong>Whatever stability there is seems fragile. Global challenges abound in the form of the continued slowdown in China, trade tensions, and Brexit. Within Europe, the German and French relationship is strained just at the moment in time when it would be best if Europe could talk with one strong voice.</p>
<p><strong>There are differences over another step toward a banking union proposed in broad strokes by the Social Democrat German Finance Minister, apparently without giving advance notice to Paris. </strong>There is also disagreement on expanding the EU (e.g., Northern Macedonia and Albania). President Macron's recent denunciation of NATO did not play well in Berlin, according to reports. Lastly, some risk to the German coalition if the leadership changes among the Social Democrats.</p>
<p><strong>The U.S. economy is slowing. </strong>The four-quarter moving average of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/gdp-375"" id=""5fc34b02e4318"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""375"">GDP</a></span> is at its lowest level since Q4 2016. Yet, that puts it at 2.0%, which is slightly more than the median Fed forecast sees as the long-run pace. The Fed says the economy is in ""a good place.""  This signals policy is on hold until a material change occurs, which puts the Fed in a reactive mode.</p>
<p><strong>The U.S. economy appears to have slowed dramatically at the start of Q4. Our previous back-of-the-envelope projection of 1% growth was dismissed as too pessimistic, but it might be too optimistic</strong>. After last week's retail sales, industrial output, and inventories data, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow was tracking 0.3% growth, and the NY Fed's model showed 0.4%. Bank economists are somewhat more optimistic, but many also cut their forecasts. Our argument that the Fed <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/central-banks/fed-rate-monitor"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""frl"">cuts rates</a></span> before the election next year is not predicated on the U.S. economy necessarily contracting. We suspect continued slowing is sufficient, provided inflation remains subdued.</p>
<p><strong>""What are the things that would cause a material change?"" one asks</strong>. Powell identified risks, and these were all downside risks. This warns that the FOMC minutes from last month's meeting (November 20) might not be hawkish, as many observers seemed to think following the meeting. If and when the Fed has to move rates again, the downside is a better guess than the upside.</p>
<p><strong>One emanated from abroad, slowing global growth. </strong>The other two (trade and the risk that inflation expectations are no longer anchored) are largely domestically-driven. The day before Powell testified, President Trump had threatened to increase the tariffs on China if a deal was not struck. A few days after the next FOMC meeting (December 11), the next round of U.S. tariffs are due to be implemented. That seems to be the timeframe for current talks now that the APEC meeting in Santiago has to be canceled due to social unrest.</p>
<p><strong>As the talks have continued and the U.S. still has not granted product-specific licenses for sales to Huawei, China has gradually been announcing a wide range of measures that grow out of self-interest but have been sought by the U.S. </strong>It has renewed purchases of U.S. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34b02e1ac8"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soy</a></span> and lifted its ban on American poultry and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/lean-hogs"" id=""5fc34b02e1be1"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8913"">pork</a></span>. It ended the quota system for foreign investment and opened some sectors, including financial services.</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile, the U.S. has slapped tariffs on ceramic tile imports from China on dumping grounds, and the U.S. Congress is trying to fast-track legislation that requires an annual certification of Hong Kong's autonomy to extend special trade status. </strong>Hong Kong is not subject to the tariffs that have been levied against the mainland. China's President Xi has escalated the official rhetoric and calling for ""stopping violence"" and ""restoring order."" The use of force by China risks the trade deal with the U.S. and incite the more independent-minded voters in Taiwan who go to the polls in a couple of months. This risk is particularly difficult to quantify, though Hong Kong's markets (equity and money markets) reflected the rising stress and anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>The U.S. reports October <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/housing-starts-151"" id=""5fc34b02e442e"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""151"">housing starts</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/existing-home-sales-99"" id=""5fc34b02e453e"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""99"">existing home sales</a></span> in the week ahead. </strong>The month-to-month changes can swing sharply, but both have been stable on a quarterly basis. Housing starts rose by an average of 1.1% in Q3 after an average increase of 1.0% in Q2. And despite the fluctuations, the 12-month moving average (1.233 mln) remains near the peak from September 2018 near 1.267 mln. Building permits remain strong. Existing home sales rose by an average of 0.5% in Q3 and Q2.</p>
<p><strong>The housing market appears to remain healthy, but the concern lies elsewhere. </strong>Leading Economic Indicators are due on November 21. There is a risk that it fell for the third consecutive month in October. This is important because the Conference Board that calculates it (from already published reports) because it is thought to identify a recession 88% of the time. Admittedly, it is a bit old-school. </p>
<p><strong>The flash November <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/manufacturing-pmi-829"" id=""5fc34b02e4650"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""829"">Markit PMI</a></span> will be reported at the end of next week. </strong>After falling sharply in August to 50.7 from 52.6, the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/markit-composite-pmi-1492"" id=""5fc34b02e476b"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1492"">composite PMI</a></span> has been stuck in the trough and was at 50.9 in October.

Trump announced he will meet the vice Premier on Friday, which bodes well for the result of trade talks. </strong></li><p></p><li><strong>Another area of tension has opened up in the US-China confrontation with the suspension of NBA pre-season broadcast in China. </strong></li><p></p><li><strong>Brace for another 'lowest growth in 30 years' headline when Q3 GDP is released next week. The headline can be made every year, though, as growth is slowing on a structural basis. </strong></li><p></p><h2>Trump to meet Chinese vice premier is a positive sign</h2><p><strong>It has truly been a bit of a roller coaster up to the US-China trade talks starting today </strong>in Washington. The latest news has been US President Donald Trump's <a href=""https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1182292163721404416"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-auth=""NotApplicable""> tweet </a>that he will meet China's top negotiator Liu He on Friday, which he has only done when talks have gone well. So this is fairly good news.</p>
<p><strong>Earlier this week, though, US </strong><a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-exclusive/us-widens-blacklist-to-include-chinas-top-ai-startups-ahead-of-trade-talks-idUSKBN1WM25M"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-auth=""NotApplicable""><strong>blacklisted</strong></a><strong> another 8 Chinese companies </strong>including some of China's top AI companies and suppliers of surveillance equipment in the Xinjiang province. The US also imposed <a href=""https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china/u-s-visa-move-against-china-casts-pall-over-talks-to-end-trade-war-idUKKBN1WN1QU"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-auth=""NotApplicable""> visa restrictions </a>on Chinese officials linked to the detention of Muslims in the Chinese province. China strongly condemned the actions and warned of retaliation. Some sources say China plans tighter visa restrictions for US nationals with ties to anti-China groups. The Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/08/china-tempers-optimism-for-a-trade-deal-ahead-of-talks.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-auth=""NotApplicable""> ""stay tuned </a>"" when asked if China would retaliate to the US blacklisting of more companies. As if this wasn't enough, another story broke that the White House is considering a <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-08/white-house-zeroes-in-on-limit-to-chinese-stocks-in-pension-fund?cmpid=BBD100819_TRADE&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=191008&amp;utm_campaign=trade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-auth=""NotApplicable""> limit on Chinese stocks </a>in US government funds. The range of negative news threw cold water on expectations for an interim deal.</p>
<p>However, on Wednesday China signalled that an interim deal was still on the table and <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/a24f6948-ea77-11e9-85f4-d00e5018f061"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-auth=""NotApplicable""> FT </a>reported that China would offer to buy 10 million tonnes of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34a86a546a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">US soybeans</a></span> in exchange for US taking tariff hikes off the table.</p>
<p>Today Bloomberg reported that the <strong>US looks to add a currency pact into the interim deal </strong>. Supposedly such a pact had been agreed to before the talks broke down and including it in an interim deal might remove one (of many) stones on the way to a broader deal eventually.</p>
<p><strong>Comment: </strong><strong>We stick to our view that there is a 60% probability of an interim trade deal. </strong>As a minimum, such a deal would include China buying agricultural goods and the US taking tariff hikes off the table again. As we've argued in past weeks, <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-exclusive/us-widens-blacklist-to-include-chinas-top-ai-startups-ahead-of-trade-talks-idUSKBN1WM25M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">both sides would have an interest</a> in that. The two sides will try to get other things into a deal but it remains to be seen if they can agree on this. The developments have shown again that China separates the trade war track from the confrontations in all the other areas like tech, Hong Kong, NBA etc. The ceasefire between Trump and Xi in December 2018 was also made only a couple of days after the Huawei CFO was arrested in Canada on request by the US.</p>
<p>An interim deal should give a lift to equities and other risk assets. However, it may be short-lived as tensions are likely to continue and Chinese retaliation on the US blacklisting could remind markets that things are far from great between US and China, even if they can agree to an interim deal.</p>
<p><strong>Another front opening up in US-China tensions</strong></p>
<p>This week another front opened up between the US and China. A tweet on 4 October by basketball team Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey in support of Hong Kong protesters triggered a firestorm in China. Chinese state TV and Tencent Sports suspended broadcasting of pre-season NBA basketball games and 11 Chinese companies that are official partners with NBA in China all said they halted business with the league.</p>
<p>Basketball is big business in China. NBA makes at least 10% of NBA’s revenues and it is expected to rise to around 20% by 2030. Nearly 500 million people in China watched NBA programs on Tencent platforms during the last season.</p>
<p>The case caught fire in the US as well when NBA on 7 October said in a statement that it was “regrettable” that M orey ’s views had deeply offended many friends and fans in China. Some US politicians attacked NBA for kowtowing to Beijing and putting “money over values”. In reaction to this, the NBA responded again this time trying to appease the US audience. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver on 8 October issued a statement saying that he won’t censor p lay ers or team owners over China or other issues and indicated that NBA would accept there were economic consequences of freedom of speech. This statement triggered an angry response in China again.</p>
<p>Comment: The case shows how the US-China tensions are broadening to people-topeople issues, and how personal views expressed by US individuals, that represent big US companies, can have economic consequences in China. It is not possible for companies to both cater to a US audience that demands freedom of speech and a Chinese audience that will not put up with insults and interference in domestic affairs.</p>
<p><strong>Brace for another ‘lowest growth in 30 years’ headline</strong></p>
<p>China will release <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/gdp-461"" id=""5fc34a86a5ae4"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""461"">GDP</a></span> growth for Q3 next week and we should prepare for another ‘lowest growth in 30 y ears’ headline hitting the wires. Growth is set to decline to 6.1% y /y, down from 6.2% y/y in Q2.</p>
<p>Comment: While it is true that it would indeed be the lowest growth in close to 30 years, it is partly the result of the structural decline in growth that China is facing. This is a decline that all ‘catching-up ’ economies face eventually . We exp ect Chinese growth rates to decline gradually towards 4½% by the end of the next decade from the current rate around 6%. However, what matters for companies is not percentage growth but absolute growth. Since China’s economy is much bigger today , China adds more to the economy today in absolute terms with 6% growth than it did 10 years ago with around 10% growth.</p>
<p>Even with growth falling to 4½% by 2030, the economy will be more than double the size at that point. And China will pass the US economy to be the biggest in the world around that time.</p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

        <p>Investing.com - U.S. soybean futures rose to a seven-week high on Monday, as ongoing concerns over a disruption to supplies from Brazil boosted prices.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc344a0bfbea"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">US soybeans</a></span> for May delivery ticked up 1.52 cents, or 0.15%, to trade at $10.3313 a bushel during U.S. morning hours after touching an intraday high of $10.3900, the most since January 12.</p>
<p>On Friday, soybean prices rose 5.2 cents, or 0.51%, to settle at $10.3160. Prices of the oilseed increased 26.26 cents, or 3.05%, last week, the fourth consecutive weekly gain.</p>
<p>A strike by Brazilian truck drivers protesting high fuel prices entered its second week, threatening to hold up grains exports at the nation's second-largest grain hub in Paranagua.</p>
<p>Brazil is a major soybean exporter and competes with the U.S. for business on the global market. A disruption to supplies there could mean increased demand for U.S. supplies.</p>

<p>The May wheat contract soared 12.4 cents, or 2.5%, on Friday to end at $5.1300 as frigid weather conditions in the U.S. Great Plains and Midwest fuelled concerns over the health of the winter-wheat crop.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">“As soon as the indicators out there said you might be able to at least cover your cost, if not make a little money, everybody (got back) to producing again.""</p>
</blockquote><p dir=""ltr"">U.S. ethanol production has increased for five weeks straight, according to some in the industry. “So we are going to over-produce again pretty rapidly,” Doyal said, voicing concerns as well about a possible resurgence in COVID-19 cases later this year and how the country might respond.&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr"">“With people learning they can work from home, there might not be as much of a demand for commuting fuel as there was before,""&nbsp;Doyal added.</p><blockquote>
<p dir=""ltr"">“So I’m not sure where we wind up on this, but we haven’t seen the pain from our destruction of the economy yet.”</p>
</blockquote><p dir=""ltr"">The EIA, in its Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) issued on Tuesday, slightly reduced its forecasts for 2020 and 2021 for both ethanol production and consumption.</p><p dir=""ltr"">The EIA predicts that U.S. ethanol production will average 850,000 barrels per day during 2020, down from its prior forecast of 870,000-barrel-per-day in May.&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr"">The EIA has also lowered its forecast for 2021 ethanol production to an average of 960,000 barrels per day, down from its prediction last month for 970,000 barrels per day.

Ethanol stocks fell to 22.476 million barrels the week ending May 29, down from 23.176 million barrels the previous week.</p><h2 dir=""ltr"">Ethanol Consumption Seen Down For The Year</h2><p dir=""ltr"">Ethanol demand, meanwhile, is expected to average 800,000 barrels per day in 2020 and 880,000 barrels per day next year, down from an average of 950,000 barrels per day in 2019. In its May report, the EIA predicted that ethanol consumption would average 820,000 barrels per day in 2020 and 890,000 barrels per day in 2021.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Overall, the EIA currently expects gasoline consumption to be down 26% this year.&nbsp;But it also suggested that fuel consumption could rebound as COVID-19-related lockdowns are relaxed.&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr"">The EIA estimates that the consumption of finished motor gasoline increased to 7.3 million barrels per day in May, up from 5.7 million barrels per day in April. The agency said personal travel numbers matched the trend of gasoline consumption. In its June STEO, the EIA cited data that showed that when compared to the last pre-lockdown week ending Feb. 29, weekly personal travel was down only 16% by May 29. It was down 47% by April 3.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Despite the EIA’s suggestion that travel and gasoline demand could pick up, some in the ethanol business remained gloomy over the outlook for the industry.</p><p dir=""ltr"">“The devastating impact of COVID-19 has hit many industries, but few were hit harder than biofuels,” Curt Blades, senior vice president at the Agricultural Services of Association of Equipment Manufacturers, wrote in an op-ed in “The Country Today,"" a Wisconsin-based newspaper.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Blades said from farmers and producers to equipment manufacturers, the virus sent shockwaves through a sector already reeling from years of regulatory mismanagement.&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr"">Half the industry has been forced offline, and the outlook remains dim without action in Washington, he added.</p><p dir=""ltr"">“Biofuels plants are epicenters for rural growth,"" Blades wrote.</p><blockquote>

        <p>Investing.com - U.S. wheat futures fell from the previous session's five-week peak on Tuesday, after the U.S. Department of Agriculture revealed that winter-wheat crop conditions improved last week.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc3452b0aec4"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">US wheat</a></span> for May delivery fell 5.28 cents, or 0.99%, to trade at $5.2813 a bushel during U.S. morning hours.</p>
<p>A day earlier, prices touched $5.4038, the most since February 18, before settling at $5.3400, up 4.0 cents, or 0.75%.</p>
<p>According to the USDA, Oklahoma winter wheat was rated 44% good to excellent, compared to 40% in the previous week, while Texas winter wheat improved by 4% to 55%.</p>
<p>In Kansas, the top wheat-producing state, the wheat crop was rated 41% good to excellent, unchanged from the previous week.</p>

<p>Brazil and Argentina are major soybean exporters and compete with the U.S. for business on the global market. Large South American crop prospects could weigh on demand for U.S. supplies.</p>

        <p>Investing.com - U.S. wheat futures traded close to a six-week low on Thursday, after agricultural meteorologists forecast further rains in key U.S. wheat-growing states.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc345b692071"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">US wheat</a></span> for May delivery hit a session low of $4.9000 a bushel, the weakest level since March 10, before trading at $4.9163 during U.S. morning hours, up 1.02 cents, or 0.21%.</p>
<p>A day earlier, wheat lost 6.2 cents, or 1.26%, to settle at $4.9060, as updated weather models forecast much-needed rains in key U.S. wheat-growing states.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture said Monday that the U.S. winter wheat crop was rated 42% good to excellent as of April 12, down from 44% in the preceding week.</p>
<p>Approximately 34% of the crop was in good to excellent condition in the same week a year earlier.</p>
<p>The agency also said that 17% of the spring wheat crop was planted as of last week, compared to just 5% in the same week a year earlier and below the five-year average of 11% for this time of year.</p>

<p>Prices remained supported amid concerns over wet weather delaying planting in the U.S. grain belt. According to the USDA, 2% of the corn crop was planted as of last week. The five-year average for this time of year is 5%.</p>

There doesn’t seem to be an answer early Monday, as stocks have a weaker tone but remain above a key technical support area. </p>
<p>The level to consider watching is right around 2942 for the S&amp;P 500 Index (<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/us-spx-500"" id=""5fc34a700b683"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""166"">SPX</a></span>). That’s the 50-day moving average, and the SPX finished solidly above it on Friday. However, the futures market isn’t necessarily reading from the same playbook this morning, a sign that maybe the rally doesn’t have strong legs. </p>
<p>It’s the last week before earnings season, so geopolitics could still play a big role in shaping performance. Talks with China start later this week, but media reports over the weekend suggest there’s doubt about how much China’s willing to talk about some of the major issues beyond just buying more U.S. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34a700ba4e"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span> and pork. China is “increasingly reluctant” to commit to reforms of industrial policy or changes to government subsidies, Bloomberg reported. It’s going to be interesting to see if the two sides can make any progress, and without the distraction of earnings until next week, any trade headlines could continue jolting the market.</p>
<p>Asian markets were mixed early Monday but European shares rose, and the bond market took a step back. The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/rates-bonds/u.s.-10-year-bond-yield"" id=""5fc34a700bb95"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""23705"">10-year Treasury yield</a></span> rose to 1.53% before the opening bell, and this is another marker to consider watching this week. The benchmark yield is just a few basis points above 1.5%, a level it hasn’t fallen below in more than a month. Any pullback in yields might suggest more trepidation about the economy.</p>
<p>Consider watching the Technology sector today for signs of possible strength, as both Apple (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/apple-computer-inc"" id=""5fc34a700bcd2"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""6408"">AAPL</a></span>) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/nvidia-corp"" id=""5fc34a700bd9e"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""6497"">NVDA</a></span>) saw analysts raise their price targets. The big earnings report to keep an eye on this week is Delta (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/delta-air-lines-new"" id=""5fc34a700beda"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8944"">DAL</a></span>) on Thursday. The company’s shares got hammered last week after DAL lowered Q3 guidance.</p>
<p></p><h3><strong>“Jobs Machine” Keeps Ticking</strong></h3>Friday’s <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/nonfarm-payrolls-227"" id=""5fc34a700c8dd"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""227"">payrolls data</a></span> continued to show that the U.S. economy is a jobs machine. The report also suggests that in a tough global neighborhood, the U.S. continues to be the healthiest place to be. Yes, the report missed on the top-line number, but a three-month job creation average of 157,000 this late in the economic cycle is pretty impressive, especially when you factor in the ultra-low <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/unemployment-rate-300"" id=""5fc34a700c9b5"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""300"">unemployment rate</a></span>, which fell to 3.5%.While manufacturing jobs didn’t gain in September, that’s a pretty volatile sector. Also, retail lost 11,000 jobs, mostly in clothing, but that probably won’t surprise anyone who’s been paying attention.Meanwhile, health care and business and professional services saw strength, and the transportation and storage sector had a 16,000-job gain. That’s a huge number, and it means we’re still shipping stuff across the country. That conceivably reinforces the theory that consumers are healthy and probably can stay that way through a solid holiday season. After the calendar turns, all bets are off if there’s no deal by then with China. If that’s the case, we could face a day of reckoning.<h3><strong>“Just Right” Data Propels Friday Rally</strong></h3><p></p>
<p>From the way the market reacted Friday, it appears investors understood the message the data sent about the economic bed not being too hard or too soft. Hopes that the slower job and wage growth might help push the Fed into making more rate cuts appeared to be a big rally driver.</p>
<p>The  energetic rally made up a lot of the week’s earlier losses and, perhaps more significantly, pushed the S&amp;P 500 Index back above its 50-day moving average by a comfortable margin. The moving average had been around 2942 entering Friday, but the SPX cleared it with about 10 points to spare. Closing that high above it could bode well for trading this week. That said, the SPX and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/us-30"" id=""5fc34a700c032"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""169"">DJI</a></span>) both suffered their third-consecutive losing weeks. </p>
<p>If you want to get picky about payrolls, wage growth didn’t budge from August and the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/average-hourly-earnings-(yoy)-1777"" id=""5fc34a700cf05"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1777"">year-over-year wage</a></span> rise dropped below 3% for the first time in months (see more below). That might partly reflect the composition of the new jobs added in September, many of which were in government and health care, not traditionally high-paying positions like construction and manufacturing. On the plus side, if wage growth starts to slow, that’s potentially one more reason why it might be hard for the Fed to argue against more rate cuts.</p>
<p>Job growth itself is slowing, and some analysts chalked it up to the trade war. There may be an element of that, though a full-employment economy like the one we’re in tends to see smaller monthly gains even when there’s no trade war. When unemployment drops to 3.5%, it can mean many companies have all the labor they need. It’s not uncommon to see 200,000 a month job growth in the beginning of a recovery, but it would be odd to continue seeing it go on and on forever. </p>
<p>At the same time, it wouldn’t be prudent, to use an expression made popular by a former U.S. president, to completely discount the possibility that global weakness and trade tensions might ultimately affect the U.S. job market. If manufacturing data continue to disappoint, it might be time to start taking that into account. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/retail-sales-256"" id=""5fc34a700cfbe"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""256"">Retail sales</a></span> data, due Oct. 16, could be important to watch as a possible sign of whether slower wage growth might be eating into consumer demand. We’ll also start hearing from Financial industry executives that week as earnings come in, and they often have a good sense of the mood on Main Street. </p>
<p>The Cboe Volatility Index (<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/volatility-s-p-500"" id=""5fc34a700c132"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""44336"">VIX</a></span>) is near 18, down from highs above 20 last week. With earnings and trade talks ahead, it wouldn’t be surprising to see more choppiness as the week advances.</p>
<p></p><h3><strong>Fed In Focus</strong></h3><p></p>
<p>It wouldn’t really be fair to finish talking about last week and payrolls without mentioning the potential Fed reaction. It’s still weeks until the Fed meets, and as one Fed official pointed out in an interview Friday, there’s a lot of data between now and then.</p>
<p>The futures market indicates 76% chances of a rate cut later this month. Those odds look pretty high, historically speaking. Additionally, odds of a second cut before the end of the year stand at approximately 40%. Fed Chairman Jerome <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/fed-chair-powell-speaks-1738"" id=""5fc34a700d084"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1738"">Powell</a></span> is scheduled to make brief remarks at 1 p.m. ET today, but it’s unclear if he’ll discuss anything too important. On Friday, he said the economy is in a ""good place,"" in his comments at a Fed Listens event. And he added it is ""our job to keep it there as long as possible."" He didn’t really discuss policy or the economy. </p>
<p>Rate cuts wouldn’t necessarily be a panacea for a market that hasn’t been able to make a new high since late July. That takes us back to the range of 2800-3000, which seems to be the mantra for the SPX. Without a trade deal, it seems hard to believe the market could move much above that anytime soon, rate cut or not, which is why it wouldn’t be surprising not to see a lot of follow-through from Friday’s fiesta.</p>

<p><strong>FOOT STILL ON THE BRAKE: </strong>The stock market might have had its best day in a while Friday, but investors still seem to be hovering over the brake pedal. That’s evident in this three month chart of the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/rates-bonds/u.s.-10-year-bond-yield"" id=""5fc34a700c24c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""23705"">U.S. 10-year Treasury yield</a></span> (TNX-candlestick) and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc34a700c36f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">gold futures</a></span> (/GC-purple line). Yields descended last week to their lowest level since early September as economic worries grew, and gold stayed close to recent highs above $1,500 an ounce as the shiny metal continues to attract investors who fear things could turn south amid trade and other geopolitical tension. Data Sources: CME Group (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/cme-group-inc."" id=""5fc34a700c4a3"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""13080"">CME</a></span>), Cboe Global Markets. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. <em>For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.</em></p>
<p><strong>One Possible Reason for Stagnant Wage Growth:</strong> The surprising thing about September’s jobs report might be how wage growth didn’t pick up despite the unemployment rate falling to 50-year lows. That’s where worries might start creeping in if the pattern continues. Typically in a full-employment economy—which we’re arguably in—workers demand higher pay and employers give in because labor supplies are tight and there’s competition for workers. That can sometimes mean higher labor costs getting passed along to consumers.</p>
<p>With inflation well under the Fed’s 2% goal, that doesn’t appear to be happening. It might be partly a function of more low-skilled workers jumping back into the job market after being absent from it for a while. Their wage demands wouldn’t necessarily be so high. The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/u6-unemployment-rate-1670"" id=""5fc34a700d4cb"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1670"">U6 unemployment</a></span> rate, which counts both unemployed and underemployed workers, was 6.9% in September, down from 7.2% in August. That category might include some of those lower-skilled, long-term unemployed workers who are now working again.</p>
<p><strong>Credit Check: </strong>Looking more closely at business health, corporate credit appears to be holding up pretty well. Some market watchers say credit is the vanguard for equities, and if that’s the case this time it might be a good sign. Falling <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/rates-bonds/u.s.-5-year-bond-yield"" id=""5fc34a700c589"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""23703"">5-year</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/rates-bonds/u.s.-2-year-bond-yield"" id=""5fc34a700c67a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""23701"">2-year</a></span> Treasury yields arguably speak to a relatively healthy credit environment for companies that want to borrow, and that could be helping support the stock market despite the weak manufacturing and service sector numbers we saw last week.</p>
<p><strong>Credit and the Consumer:</strong> Speaking of credit, later today investors are scheduled to see the latest reading on consumer credit from the Federal Reserve. Consumer borrowing in August is expected to have increased by $13.3 billion, according to a Briefing.com consensus. The last reading we saw, for July, showed an increase of $23.3 billion as revolving credit, such as credit cards, grew at the fastest pace since November 2017. With the U.S. consumer in focus, the picture of consumer credit is important.</p>
<p>Although we’ve seen evidence of some headwinds in consumer spending, sentiment, and confidence data recently, it seems that the consumer overall is still pretty healthy and that could be behind the rise in consumer borrowing.</p>

        <p>By Geoffrey Smith </p>
<p>Investing.com -- China said it will cut tariffs on some U.S. imports, sparking further gains in global stocks. The spread of the coronavirus appears to be slowing, according to the latest data on deaths and new infections. Oil markets reacted cautiously to reports that OPEC and its allies may cut another 600,000 barrels a day to bring the world oil market back into balance. Christine Lagarde warned the European parliament that the ECB is running out of road for further policy stimulus. And of course there's a whole load more corporate earnings coming down the track later. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, 6th February.</p>
<p><strong>1. China cuts tariffs on U.S. imports</strong></p>
<p>China said it will cut tariffs on an annual $75 billion worth of U.S. imports from Friday, reciprocating the partial roll-back in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods that the two sides agreed last month.</p>
<p></p><p>Although the step was as expected and hardly moved the price of commodities that were affected such as <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc3507f33901"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span> and oil, it cements the recent truce between the two and supports hopes that the biggest drag on the global economy will fade this year.</p><p></p>
<p>The news overshadowed hints elsewhere from the Chinese press that the government may seek to use the coronavirus outbreak as an excuse not to buy the full volume of U.S. goods it agreed to in January.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, China’s biggest buyer of gas CNOOC reportedly declared force majeure on contracts to import liquefied <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/natural-gas"" id=""5fc3507f33db7"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8862"">natural gas</a></span>, a reflection of the collapse in industrial demand following the extended shutdown of Chinese factories due to the outbreak.</p>
<p><strong>2. Global markets extend risk rally, mostly</strong></p>
<p>The headlines on the tariff cuts were still all that was needed to justify another move up in global stock markets overnight. Major Chinese stock indices rose by between 1.4% and 2.8%, while the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/stoxx-600"" id=""5fc3507f33f00"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""40823"">Euro Stoxx 600</a></span> hit a new all-time high before retracing its gains.</p>
<p>However, commodities and emerging market currencies were less impressed.  Crude futures gave up early gains after reports that China is also looking to cut purchases of Saudi Arabian oil due to the coronavirus impact on local demand, amidst reports that refineries have slashed throughput.</p>
<p></p><p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/copper"" id=""5fc3507f3402c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8831"">Copper</a></span> futures also could only drift sideways, while there were better bids for haven metals <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc3507f34117"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">Gold</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/silver"" id=""5fc3507f3421f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8836"">Silver</a></span> than for industrial ones such as <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/aluminum"" id=""5fc3507f34366"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""49768"">Aluminum</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/nickel?cid=959208"" id=""5fc3507f344b6"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""959208"">Nickel</a></span>.</p><p></p>
<p>The virus itself continues to spread, although both the incidence of new cases and the death toll are rising more slowly than at any time so far during the outbreak. “The trend rate of increase is slowing,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Economics in London.</p>
<p><strong>3. OPEC+ officials reportedly recommend further oil output cuts</strong></p>
<p>The world’s biggest oil exporters look set to cut their production even more deeply in order to restore balance to an oversupplied global market suffering from the impact of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Newswire reports suggested that the technical experts from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia would recommend additional supply cuts of 600,000 barrels a day. That compares with an estimate from <span itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Corporation""><span itemprop=""name""> <span itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Corporation""><span itemprop=""name""> BP </span></span> </span></span> (LON:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/bp"" id=""5fc3507f345e8"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""284"">BP</a></span>) earlier this week that the virus could hit destroy an average of 400,000 b/d over the whole year.</p>
<p></p><p>However, it wasn’t clear whether Russia’s government would support the action. Russia has argued that U.S. shale producers should take more of the strain in balancing the market, having ramped up their output considerably at the cartel’s expense last year. </p>
<p>Crude markets reacted cautiously: <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc3507f34760"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">U.S. crude</a></span> futures were up 0.9% at $51.88 a barrel, while <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/brent-oil"" id=""5fc3507f3487d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8833"">Brent</a></span> was up 0.2% at $55.38, but both blends were off intra-day highs posted earlier.</p><p></p>

It follows on the heels of a separate order last week for 1.36 mln tons (almost evenly divided between delivery by the end of August and for the year beginning Sept. 1. China has also boosted its orders for soy and wheat in recent weeks too. It sounds impressive, and it is, but it is still small beer. Consider that two orders for corn together are worth around $410 mln. China agreed to double its agriculture exports from the 2017 level of $24 bln.</p>
<p><strong>The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/boj-interest-rate-decision-165"" id=""5fc3531553c39"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""165"">Bank of Japan</a></span>, as widely anticipated, did not alter policy. </strong>However, its forecasts show that its pessimism has not been lifted. In April, it forecast the economy would shrink by 3%-5% in the fiscal year ending next March. Today's forecast puts the contraction at 4.7%, and that assumes not another widespread shutdown. While that may seem reasonable, Tokyo raised its alert level to its highest today.</p>
<p><strong>Since China enacted its new security law in Hong Kong, there has been a threat of a brain-drain, as several countries, including the UK and Australia, make it easier for Hong Kong nationals to emigrate. </strong>While China has taken offense, it does not want to be left behind. Reports suggest it is shifting its tax on Chinese citizens to include their global income. This is effectively a large tax hike on those living in HK.</p>

<h2>Europe</h2>
<p><strong>The jockeying for position ahead of the EU's summit at the end of the week continues. There are two sources of misdirection. First, the commentariat class consumed many column inches, debating explaining what a common bond is necessary and appropriate now. </strong>The big&nbsp;Hamilton Momentum. Yet, it is among the least controversial elements. Second, the ""Frugal Four"" was seen as the main obstacle. It has been clear for several weeks at least that they could largely be coopted through expanding rebates. As the selection of the Eurogroup President recently illustrated, eastern and central European members.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Yesterday, Hungary's parliament approved a resolution for Prime Minister Orban to reject the EU Recovery Plan and seven-year budget until the EC ends its investigation into potential violations of the rule of law. </strong>The EU decision needs to be unanimous, and given the urgency, it creates a powerful incentive for a defect, i.e., hold out for individual concession. Merkel seems to have suggested that she has room to compromise, while Dutch Prime Minister Rutte sounded doubtful, and agreement can be reached.</p>
<p><strong>On the eve of the summit, the EU has been dealt a blow. </strong>The General Court, the second-highest in the EU, ruled against the EC's decision that ordered Apple (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/apple-computer-inc"" id=""5fc3531552668"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""6408"">AAPL</a></span>) to pay 13 bln euros in back taxes to the Irish government in 2016. The court ruled that the EC failed to demonstrate that the tax arrangement was an illegal state subsidy. The EU can appeal the decision, but it seems to undermine Brussels' effort to pursue low tax members. In recent days, reports had surfaced, suggesting the EC was going to try a new tactic in addressing the corporate tax regimes that seem to facilitate tax avoidance strategies. The Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium, and Ireland were the likely targets, and EC sought an approach that would require a qualified majority rather than unanimity.</p>
<p><strong>The UK reported June inflation figures. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cpih-1798"" id=""5fc35315541c1"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1798"">CPIH</a></span></strong>&nbsp;rose 0.8% year-over-year after a 0.7% pace in May. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cpi-727"" id=""5fc353155428e"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""727"">CPI</a></span> itself rose 0.1% in June for a 0.6% year-over-year rate.

<p><strong>The euro reached four-month highs in early European turnover near $1.1445, just shy of the $1.1450 option for nearly 825 mln euros that expires today. </strong>The intraday technicals are stretched, and the immediate risk is on the downside.

<h2>America</h2>
<p><strong>It is the first policy decision for the new <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/boc-interest-rate-decision-166"" id=""5fc353155462c"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""166"">Bank of Canada Governor Macklem</a></span>. </strong>It is also the first meeting since the government clarified its fiscal strategy.

Since April, the central bank has been buying almost C$7 bln a week after committing to buying at least C$5 bln a week. Some observers argue that the increased government outlays requires the central bank to buy more bonds. However, we suspect the government issuance is only one variable in the equation, and it may not be the decisive one.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Long-term asset purchases appear primarily aimed at either helping markets stabilize or supporting financial conditions when the zero-bound has been approached. </strong>The markets have stabilized, and so have interest rates.

The Reserve Bank of Australia is targeting it at the cash rate of 25 bp. The three-year yield in Canada has been hovering around 30 bp for more than a month. There is no upside pressure.

That said, the Canadian dollar is the only major that has fallen against the US dollar over the past month. However, for all practical purposes, the decline is immaterial for policymakers. Meanwhile, illustrated by June <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/employment-change-95"" id=""5fc3531554af1"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""95"">employment</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/housing-starts-150"" id=""5fc3531554ebc"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""150"">housing starts</a></span>, the economy is on the mend.

It rose 1.4% in May and is expected to have accelerated by more than 4% in June. Last year, industrial output fell in seven of the 12 months. Manufacturing production fell by 5.3% and 15.5% in March and April before bouncing by 3.8% in May. It is expected to have risen by a little more than 5.5% last month.

</ul><p>When most people think of crude oil, the last commodity that then comes to mind is sugar. Crude oil is the leading member of the energy sector within the commodities market. The crude oil futures contract typically has the highest level of trading volume and open interest—also known as the largest number of open long and short positions. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc351d5165e9"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">Crude oil futures</a></span> trade on the NYMEX division of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.&nbsp;</p>

It tends to have the highest level of volume and open interest of all of the soft commodities that trade on the Intercontinental Exchange or ICE.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The prices of sugar and crude oil futures correlate well because, in some parts of the world, sugar is the primary ingredient in the biofuel ethanol. Indeed, crude oil and sugar fell to new lows in April.</p>
<p>As most will remember, April was an ugly month in the crude oil market. In fact, it was the ugliest month ever for the energy commodity in the NYMEX futures market.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The price of sugar futures on the Intercontinental Exchange declined to a low of 9.05 cents per pound in April. The last time the sweet agricultural commodity fell below that price was back in September 2007.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brazil is the world’s leading producer and exporter of sugarcane. Which means sugar is all about Brazil where the ag commodity plays a dual role.</p>
<p>While sugar is a critical ingredient in many food products, it is also the primary input in the production of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/ethanol-futures?cid=964525"" id=""5fc351d51694b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""964525"">ethanol</a></span> in Brazil, South America’s most populous and leading economy. Brazil and the US are the two top ethanol producers in the world. In the US, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc351d516a2a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">corn</a></span> is the ingredient in the biofuel, but in Brazil, it is all about sugar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The quarterly chart shows that the price of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/ethanol-futures"" id=""5fc351d516af3"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""961732"">Ethanol Futures</a></span> declined to a record low of 79.9 cents per gallon in April 2020. Crude oil weighed on ethanol, and ethanol sent sugar to the lowest price in thirteen years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brazil's currency, the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-brl"" id=""5fc351d516bd0"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""2103"">real</a></span>, is another key factor in the sugar market. Its recent decline created an almost perfect bearish storm.</p>
<p>At the same time that crude oil selling was making the price of sugar a lot less sweet, the price action in the Brazilian currency added to the bearish price action in the sugar futures market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since Brazil is the leading producer, the local production costs that include labor to grow, mill and transport sugar are in local currency terms. The ICE futures price sugar in US dollar terms, so when the value of Brazil’s currency declines, it tends to put pressure on the price of the soft commodity.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img title=""USD/BRL Monthly 2007-2020"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picf576ace44a2aabe20653fa02c197a8e8.png"" alt=""USD/BRL Monthly 2007-2020""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">USD/BRL Monthly 2007-2020</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p>The chart above, of the foreign exchange relationship between the US dollar and the Brazilian real shows that the real fell to its lowest level at $0.16775 against the dollar in May. The trend in the currency pair has been lower since the real traded to a high of $0.65095 against the US currency in 2011.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sugar is highly sensitive to energy prices, but it also reflects the currency differential between Brazil’s currency and the US dollar. Sugar traded to a high of 36.08 cents per pound in 2011 when the real hit $0.65095 against the dollar. At 10.29 cents at the end of last week, the price of sugar had declined by 71.48% since 2011. At $0.1734 against the dollar, the Brazilian currency dropped by 73.36%. The bottom line is that the price of sugar in Brazil in May 2020 is 1.88% higher than it was in 2011 when it was trading at over 36 cents per pound in dollar terms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When trading or investing in the sugar market, crude oil and the Brazilian real are two critical factors to watch. Each can influence the path of least resistance of the price of the sweetest commodity.&nbsp;</p><div>&nbsp;</div>

With this balance sheet, with bullish numbers for soybeans as well, and no change in South American corn or soybean production or exports while China to buy, this is going to be an interesting 2020/21 year in grains.

    </div>
        <p>Investing.com - U.S. soybean futures fell to a one-week low on Wednesday, as optimism over the outlook for supplies in Brazil and Argentina drove down prices.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc345853b490"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">US soybeans</a></span> for May delivery hit a session low of $9.7013 a bushel, the weakest level since March 31, before trading at $9.7163 during U.S. morning hours, up 0.42 cents, or 0.04%.</p>
<p>A day earlier, soybean prices slumped 7.4 cents, or 0.77%, to close at $9.7100.</p>
<p>Brazil and Argentina are major soybean exporters and compete with the U.S. for business on the global market. Large South American crop prospects could weigh on demand for U.S. supplies.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the Chicago Board of Trade, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc345853b76a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">US wheat</a></span> for May delivery dipped 0.57 cents, or 0.11%, to trade at $5.2563 a bushel. On Tuesday, wheat shed 1.6 cents, or 0.33%, to settle at $5.2600 as forecasts for much-needed rainfall in the U.S. grain belt eased concerns over the health of the winter-wheat crop.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture said Monday that the U.S. winter wheat crop was rated 44% good to excellent, compared to 35% in the same week a year earlier. The five-year average for the first week in April is 47%.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc345853b866"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">US corn</a></span> for May delivery inched up 0.03 cents, or 0.01%, to trade at $3.8363 a bushel. Corn declined 2.0 cents, or 0.52%, on Tuesday to end at $3.8300 amid indications of ample supplies.</p>
<p>The USDA said last week that U.S. corn inventories on March 1 totaled 7.745 billion bushels, 11% higher than last year.</p>
<p>The agency also projected U.S. farmers would plant 89.199 million acres with corn in 2015, surpassing forecasts for 88.735 million but down from 90.597 million in 2014.</p>
<p>Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, government figures show. Wheat was fourth, behind hay.</p>

        <p>Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, April 4:</p>
<p><strong>1. China Announces Retaliatory Tariffs Against U.S. Goods</strong></p>
<p>China hit back at the Trump administration's plan to slap tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/news/economy-news/china-vows-countermeasures-as-us-issues-extensive-tariff-list-1376754"" id=""5fc34f08b6b85"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""oal"" data-articleid=""1376754"">retaliating with a list of similar duties on key U.S. imports</a></span>, including soybeans, planes, cars, whiskey and chemicals.</p>
<p>Beijing's list of 25% additional tariffs on U.S. goods covers 106 items with a trade value matching the $50 billion targeted on Washington's list, China's commerce and finance ministries said.</p>
<p>The effective date will depend on when the U.S. action takes effect.</p>
<p>The move comes one day after the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/news/economy-news/us-unveils-tariffs-on-50-billion-worth-of-chinese-imports-1376646"" id=""5fc34f08b6dc3"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""oal"" data-articleid=""1376646"">Trump administration pushed ahead with plans to slap tariffs</a></span> on about $50 billion of Chinese industrial and hi-tech products, adding to market fears that world's two largest economies are spiraling towards a trade war that could shake the global economy.</p>

<p>Of note, industrial companies with significant exposure to China were showing big losses in premarket action, with plane manufacturer Boeing (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/boeing-co"" id=""5fc34f08b5b37"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""238"">BA</a></span>) dropping as much as 6%, while heavy-machinery maker <span itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Corporation""><span itemprop=""name""> Caterpillar </span></span> (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/caterpillar"" id=""5fc34f08b5c6b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""247"">CAT</a></span>) fell 4%.</p>

<p><strong>4. U.S. Grain Prices Take A Nosedive</strong></p>
<p>U.S. grain futures took a nosedive, with the price of soybeans and corn faring the worst, as investors <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/news/commodities-news/china-hits-us-where-it-hurts-with-25-tariff-on-soybeans-1376889"" id=""5fc34f08b7499"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""oal"" data-articleid=""1376889"">fret over a slowdown in Chinese demand</a></span> for U.S. agricultural goods in the wake of China's latest trade measure.</p>

<p><strong>5. Oil Prices Struggle Ahead Of EIA Supply Data</strong></p>
<p>Oil traders looked ahead to fresh weekly data on U.S. commercial crude inventories to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer and how fast output levels will continue to rise.</p>
<p>The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/crude-oil-inventories-75"" id=""5fc34f08b683f"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""75"">weekly report on oil supplies</a></span> at 10:30AM ET (1430GMT), amid analyst expectations for a gain of 1.4 million barrels.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- For the first time in 35 years, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34ef759f4c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span> are poised to steal the crown of U.S. crop king from corn.</p>
<p>American farmers are set to increase their soy plantings to a record 90.69 million acres, according to the average estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 21 trading firms and analysts. Corn sowings are forecast to drop to 90.12 million. The last time soy surpassed corn was 1983, when government payments were based on idling acres.</p>
<p>For the full survey results, click here.</p>
<p>If it feels like we’ve been here before, you’d be right. This time last year analysts were expecting the great soybean steal to happen because the crop was already offering better premiums. And while growers did sow more of the oilseed than ever before, the plantings came in just shy of matching corn as temperate weather favored the grain.</p>
<p>So what’s different this year? Drought.</p>
<p>About 16 percent of the corn belt is already experiencing drought conditions, with more dry weather forecast into the start of the growing season. Soybeans, wheat and cotton are all more drought-tolerant than corn.</p>
<p>Price Premiums</p>
<p>Prices are also still favoring soybeans, with futures for this year’s crop trading about 2.5 times higher than corn contracts. This is the fifth straight year that the oilseed is offering better returns.</p>
<p>After years of depressed crop prices, those premiums are more important than ever -- just ask Julie Burgod. The 52-year-old farms 4,500 acres and raises calves near ‬Ipswich, South Dakota, with her husband and son. They already plan to slash corn acres in half to make way for soybeans, because the grain “doesn’t pay the bills.” Burgod also owns a crop insurance agency and said many of her clients are echoing the sentiment.</p>
<p>“Soybeans are king, and corn is queen,” Burgod said. “We also are skittish about the dry soils coming into 2018.” </p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture will release its first planting estimates for the season at its annual outlook conference that begins Thursday in Arlington, Virginia.</p>
<p>Plains Drought</p>
<p>Dry weather is most acute in the northern Great Plains. In North Dakota, drought conditions cover 65 percent of the state, compared with zero last year, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.</p>
<p>The arid soils are limiting planting options, according to Jim Diepolder, a farmer and seed and farm-chemical dealer near Willow City, North Dakota. The conditions reduce the chances of corn crops generating the yields needed for farmers to break even. Barley is also less attractive after a string of bumper crops boosted inventories, prompting beer companies to cut supply contracts.</p>
<p>Diepolder is planting no corn this year, 50 percent less barley and replacing those acres with another grain that’s forecast to see planting gains: wheat. He’ll also seed more canola. Both crops are considered drought resistant.</p>
<p>“I watch the weather and I watch market prices, but weather is the key,” Diepolder said “The drier it gets, the more spring wheat will get planted because it’s a good drought crop. You have to have something to sell at harvest.”</p>

Later in the day, investors may also pay some attention to a new round of Brexit talks, the last ahead of the June 18th and 19th EU summit.</p><h3><strong>INVESTORS KEEP PUSHING RISKY ASSETS NORTH</strong></h3><p>The US dollar continued trading south against most of the other G10 currencies on Monday and during the Asian morning Tuesday. It underperformed the most versus CAD, AUD, and NZD in that order, while it eked out minor gains only against EUR, CHF, and JPY.<br></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic530a522e74a2708d4717224fab4ba465.png"" alt=""USD performance G10 currencies"" border=""0""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">USD performance G10 currencies</span></div></div></div><br>The strengthening of the commodity-linked currencies and the weakening of the safe havens suggest that investors’ appetite remained supported for another day. Indeed, turning our gaze to the equity world, we see that major EU and US indices traded in the green, with the positive morale rolling into the Asian session today.<br><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picb0b00f256379202adc2c5ac744518c6c.png"" alt=""Major global stock indices performance"" border=""0""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Major global stock indices performance</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p>It seems that investors continued placing bets on the prospect of a global economic recovery as governments around the globe continue to ease their lockdown measures adopted due to the fast-spreading coronavirus. Market participants may have also taken relief after US President Trump announced on Friday that he would end special treatment for Hong Kong, avoiding bold action against China, like the imposition of sanctions and/or fresh tariffs. This may have allowed market participants to maintain hopes that the “Phase One” trade deal between the world’s two largest economies will stay in place and that at some point in the future, the two nations could eventually finalize an accord.</p>
<p>That said, that was tempered somewhat by reports that China has told state-owned firms to stop farm purchases from the US, notably soybeans. Anyhow, China hasn’t been buying <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34cb2a1da8"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">US soybeans</a></span> this year and thus, risk appetite recovered again. Another negative was that US President Trump will send US troops into the streets to control violence triggered by the death of George Floyd in police custody. This may have raised concerns over a national economic recovery, as well as fears of a second wave of coronavirus infections. That said, markets shrugged off this news as well.</p>
<p>As for our view, it has not changed. As we already noted, it seems that investors are more focused on the prospect of a global economic recovery and barring any fresh and more serious tensions between the US and China, they may continue to increase their risk exposures. As we noted several times in the past, among currency pairs, one of the best gauges of the broader market sentiment may be <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/aud-jpy"" id=""5fc34cb2a1efd"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""49"">AUD/JPY</a></span>. As a risk-linked currency, the Aussie may continue to attract flows as investors divert their capital out of safe havens like the yen. In short, we expect AUD/JPY to continue trading north in the near term. We believe that for that to change, the US and China may have to scale back the progress made so far in their trade relationship and/or to start another round of tit-for-tat tariffs.</p><h3><strong>AUD/JPY – TECHNICAL OUTLOOK</strong></h3><p>AUD/JPY is still comfortably moving higher, while balancing above a short-term upside support line taken from the low of May 15th. This morning, the pair is already testing the high of yesterday, at 73.30, which suggests that the bulls are still willing to drive AUD/JPY higher. We will remain positive and aim for higher areas, as long as the pair stays above the aforementioned upside line.</p>
<p>A strong push above yesterday’s high, at 73.30, would confirm a forthcoming higher high and may set the stage for further advances. AUD/JPY could then drift to the 73.90 hurdle, which is the high of February 24th, a break of which may help the bulls to lift the rate to the highest point of February, at 74.47.<br><br>On the downside, if the previously-discussed upside line breaks and the rate falls below the 71.60 zone, which is near yesterday’s low, that may signal a change in the short-term trend. AUD/JPY might then fall under the influence of even more bears, who could send the rate further down. This is when the pair may test the 70.81 obstacle, a break of which might set the stage for a push towards the 69.94 level, marked by the low of May 22nd. <br></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic3a9a642a31030090be7fadf82326fe63.png"" alt=""AUD/JPY 4-hour chart technical analysis"" border=""0""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">AUD/JPY 4-hour chart technical analysis</span></div></div></div><p></p><h3><strong>RBA STANDS PAT, BREXIT TALKS RESTART</strong></h3><p>Speaking about the Aussie, during the early morning today, we had an RBA decision. However, there were no fireworks in the aftermath. The Bank kept its benchmark rate and the target of its 3-year government bond yields unchanged at +0.25%, with officials noting that they have purchased government bonds on only one occasion since the previous meeting. They also repeated that they are prepared to scale-up bond purchases again if necessary.<br></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic9aab30bf4012fe49f4de9349aa907bbb.png"" alt=""RBA interest rates"" border=""0""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">RBA interest rates</span></div></div></div><br>The Aussie barely reacted to the announcement, perhaps as this was the base-case outcome. Remember, yesterday we noted the prospect of better days may have allowed RBA officials to continue reducing their bond purchases. It appears that the main driving force of the Australian currency is the improvement in the broader market sentiment, and as we already noted, we expect this to continue for a while more.<br>As for today, market participants may pay some attention to the start of another round of Brexit negotiations. This would be the final round ahead of the June 18th and 19th EU summit, by which the UK must decide whether to ask for an extension to the transition period, or not. With PM Johnson insisting over a December 31st deadline, a failure to find common ground is likely to increase fears over a disorderly exit in the end of the year, which combined with the prospect of negative interest rates by the BoE, may keep the pound pressured. That said, we would prefer to exploit any further pound weakness against currencies which we expect to stay strong, like the commodity-linked ones. One of the pairs we would expect to extend its current downtrend is <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/gbp-aud"" id=""5fc34cb2a2031"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""53"">GBP/AUD</a></span>.<p></p><h3><strong>GBP/AUD – TECHNICAL OUTLOOK</strong></h3><p>GBP/AUD continues its journey south, after the reversal in the beginning of April. The pair is trading below a tentative downside resistance line taken from the highest point of May, which if stays intact could indicate the direction in which the rate might move further. That said, to get a bit more comfortable with further extensions to the downside, we would like to see a drop below yesterday’s low, at 1.8332.</p>
<p>If the pair falls below the above-mentioned hurdle, at 1.8332, that would confirm a forthcoming lower low and more bears could join in and GBP/AUD may slide further south. The pair could easily test the next support area between the 1.8230 and 1.8200 levels, marked by the high of October 9th and by an intraday swing high of October 10th respectively. The rate could stall there initially, or even rebound, however if it continues to trade below the aforementioned downside line, that may be a sign for the sellers to step in again in order to drive the pair down again. If GBP/AUD manages to break the 1.8200 obstacle this time, the next potential support area to consider could be the 1.8075 level, marked by the lowest point of October 2019.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the previously-discussed downside line breaks and the rate rises above the 1.8549 barrier, marked by yesterday’s high, this could signal a change in the current trend and clear the path for further advances. If so, GBP/AUD may drift to the 1.8659 obstacle, a break of which could set the stage for a test of the 1.8760 hurdle, which is the high of May 19th. The pair might stall there temporarily, however, if the buyers are still feeling comfortable, the next possible resistance zone could be near the 1.8843 level, marked by the low of May 15th and the high of May 17th.<br></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic703e68051fda27c2004de524e422ef21.png"" alt=""GBP/AUD 4-hour chart technical analysis"" border=""0""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">GBP/AUD 4-hour chart technical analysis</span></div></div></div><p></p><h3><strong>AS FOR THE REST OF TODAY’S EVENTS</strong></h3><p>The economic calendar for today appears very light with no major economic indicators on the schedule.

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- The agriculture markets are getting a lift as U.S. trade relations improve with Mexico, one of the largest foreign buyers of American meat and grain.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump on Monday announced that the U.S. and Mexico have a trade agreement. Hog futures jumped earlier and corn erased most of its losses after Bloomberg News reported that a deal was coming. Mexico imports more pork from American farmers than any other country and is a major destination for corn.</p>
<p>October <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/lean-hogs"" id=""5fc356b1ad857"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8913"">hog futures</a></span> jumped as much as 3 cents a pound, the maximum allowed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and cattle also rose by the limit. December <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc356b1adaf4"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">corn futures</a></span> on the Chicago Board of Trade pared earlier losses to trade almost unchanged after the trade deal was reported.</p>
<p>Trump hailed the deal with Mexico to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement as “a big day for trade” and said he plans to change the name of a reworked version of the accord. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said he hoped Canada would soon be incorporated in the revised agreement, while Trump said that remains to be seen.</p>
<p>In June, Mexico imposed tariffs on U.S. products including cheese and pork in retaliation for American taxes on steel and aluminum. That contributed to tumbling hog prices, with the October contract trading at a record low earlier this month.</p>
<p>“Mexico, agriculturally, is very important to us,” said Lawrence Kane, a market adviser with Stewart-Peterson Group in Yates City, Illinois.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">“China has already commented that if these are severe, they will retaliate by reducing purchases from the United States and have already instructed the state-owned grain companies, Cofco and Sinograin to suspend purchases of U.S. farm goods.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

The ethanol content of most of the motor gasoline sold in the United States does not exceed 10% by volume.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=""ltr""><strong>Brighter Times Under Biden?</strong></h2><p dir=""ltr"">Some of those who track the industry, however, think ethanol could be in for brighter times with the environment-focused policies of President-Elect Joseph Biden, who takes office Jan. 20. While there are concerns the Biden administration will prioritize renewables over fossil fuels, market watchers think biofuel’s importance in the current energy mix looks set to be preserved<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Others are more pessimistic. They anticipate lower demand for gasoline through December due to the seasonal slack in fuel uptake during the winter, and more fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. That will limit any upside for ethanol, they argue.&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr"">Dan Flynn, analyst at the Price Futures Group in Chicago, is expecting positive change for ethanol under the Biden administration. His rationale:</p><blockquote>
<p>“On the ethanol front, the market is loving the continued success in the corn and soybeans strength. The industry is ready to jockey for position and see what type of transition of administrations will impact the grains and energy markets when the vote is officially certified.”&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">“The market will most likely follow the grains and energies, until there is more concrete news to deliver.”</p>
</blockquote><h2 dir=""ltr""><strong>Expect More Of The Same From Winter And COVID</strong></h2><p dir=""ltr"">Farzad Taheripour, research associate professor in the department of agricultural economics at Purdue University, argues that gasoline demand will likely drop by about 10% between now and the end of the year due to winter and other conditions. He says:</p><blockquote>
<p dir=""ltr"">“We were projecting that by the end of 2020, the reduction in demand for gasoline would be less than 10%.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>In a blog posted on SeedWorld, he adds:</p><blockquote>
<p dir=""ltr"">“Actual observations now confirm that the demand for gasoline in September was 9% lower than its level in 2019.""</p>
</blockquote><p dir=""ltr"">Taheripour says that In terms of actual data, the demand for gasoline dropped from 400 million gallons per day to about 200 to 250 million gallons in April and May. But as the COVID-19 restrictions changed, demand for gasoline gradually began to increase to more than 350 million gallons per day in September.&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr"">Taheripour foresees a further slide in ethanol consumption as the year winds to a close.&nbsp;He explained:</p><blockquote>
<p dir=""ltr"">“My expectation is that we may see another round of reduction in gasoline demand.”&nbsp;</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">“Because of that, we may observe some reduction in demand for ethanol again towards the end of this year, as the cold season and flu season spreads and surges in the COVID-19 cases again.”</p>
</blockquote><p dir=""ltr"">In Tuesday’s session, Chicago-traded ethanol settled at $1.44 per gallon. Over a compounded four-weeks from Oct. 16, it was down 5%.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Gasoline was, meanwhile, up 1.4% for the four compounded weeks, settling on Tuesday at above $1.15 per gallon.</p><p dir=""ltr"">West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. oil benchmark, was up 16% in the same period, hovering&nbsp; at $41.50 per barrel.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">Investing.com’s Daily Technical Indicator has ethanol at a “Sell” with a three-tier Fibonacci support that begins at $1.437, and emerges again at $1.423, before a strong buying signal that kicks in at $1.400.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Should ethanol reverse its current trend and turn upward, then it will likely find a three-tier Fibonacci resistance that begins at $1.483 and progresses to $1.497, before selling pressure that likely emerges at $1.520.</p><p dir=""ltr"">As with all projections, we urge you to follow the calls but temper them with fundamentals—and moderation—whenever possible.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Good luck.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> <em>Barani Krishnan uses a range of views outside his own to bring diversity to his analysis of any market.

<p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img title=""GLD - TLT Daily Chart"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picf7fdcea6edc2bbff5730e7d8eaab2349.jpg"" alt=""GLD - TLT Daily Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">GLD - TLT Daily Chart</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p>First was the focus on the junk bonds (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/etfs/spdr-barclays-high-yield-bond"" id=""5fc34d300b312"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""40651"">JNK</a></span>) and&nbsp;investment grade bonds (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/etfs/ishares-inv-g-bond"" id=""5fc34d300ba20"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""40648"">LQD</a></span>).</p>
<p>Junk bonds have remained strong indicating the appetite for high risk companies has not waned-good, news for the market.</p>
<p>LQD or investment grade bonds sold off into a warning phase. However, on a weekly chart, it held just where it needed to at 134.54-the area of support for now.</p>
<p>Second was the focus on the banking and financial sectors of the market.</p>
<p>Although those sectors saw a brief pop, XLF (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/etfs/financial-select-sector-spdr-fund"" id=""5fc34d300be7f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""40668"">XLF</a></span>) and KRE (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/etfs/spdr-kbw-regional-banking"" id=""5fc34d300bf58"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""38281"">KRE</a></span>) are pretty much exactly at the prices they were when I left.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>Most likely, these areas reflect the reality of the economy and how many loan defaults and bankruptcies continue to plague real economic growth.</p>
<p>Third was the dollar, low rates, rising metals, up move in sugar and all the factors that still support a stagflation theory.</p>
<p>Is that still in play?</p>
<p>No doubt the recent rally to new highs in the S&amp;P 500 (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/etfs/spdr-s-p-500"" id=""5fc34d300cbbf"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""525"">SPY</a></span>) and Nasdaq (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/etfs/powershares-qqqq"" id=""5fc34d300cca4"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""651"">QQQ</a></span>) is impressive.</p>
<p>However, this market remains divided, with stocks skyrocketing or languishing and not much in between.</p>
<p>The Economic Modern Family is equally mixed with the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/smallcap-2000"" id=""5fc34d300cd6b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""170"">Russell 2000</a></span> (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/etfs/ishares-russell-2000-index-etf"" id=""5fc34d300ce31"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""14202"">IWM</a></span>) and&nbsp;Russell 3000 (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/etfs/ishares-russell-3000"" id=""5fc34d300cefc"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""45175"">IWV</a></span>) trading sideways.&nbsp;Regional Banks (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/etfs/spdr-kbw-regional-banking"" id=""5fc34d300d37f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""38281"">KRE</a></span>) stuck near the bottom of the range and Semiconductors (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/etfs/holdrs-merrill-lynch-semiconductor"" id=""5fc34d300d45e"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""45118"">SMH</a></span>) are flying.</p>
<p>Here is where we see the stagnation part of the stagflation theory.</p>
<p>To date, grains (<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc34d300d524"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">wheat</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34d300d5e6"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span>), which I have pointed out repeatedly as trading at 100-year lows versus the SPY, have rallied well.</p>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc34d300d6a5"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">Gold</a></span> has held its gains although has yet to convincingly clear $2000 an ounce.</p>
<p>Rates have firmed a bit while the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/us-dollar-index"" id=""5fc34d300d764"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8827"">dollar</a></span> continues to freefall. Only yesterday, the dollar found some footing, which could take it to test overhead resistance.</p>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-sugar-no11"" id=""5fc34d300d82b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8869"">Sugar</a></span>, my secret sauce for stagflation, edged higher. Above both the 50 and 200-DMAs, provided cash holds above 12.25, sugar can continue to tell us more about rising food costs amid supply chain disruptions.</p>
<p>I am still watching commodities, particularly gold and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/silver"" id=""5fc34d300d8e9"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8836"">silver</a></span>.</p>
<p>And now, with civil unrest a daily headline globally as well in the US, the market, which is very one-sided towards tech, could be close to overdone.</p>
<p>For that, volatility is a key to keep eyes on.</p>

    </div>
        <p>(Bloomberg) -- Commodities were a big casualty of the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China, but are now set to be a major beneficiary of Beijing’s pledge to import more American goods.</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump had threatened to impose tariffs on as much as $150 billion in Chinese imports, including some steel and aluminum products, to punish Beijing for allegedly violating American intellectual property and unfair trade practices. The Asian nation vowed to retaliate with tariffs on everything from soybeans to fruit and wine.</p>
<p>But after two days of talks in Washington, the two countries on Saturday declared an economic truce, putting their tariffs plan on hold. In a joint statement released by the White House, China said it agreed to “meaningful increases in U.S. agriculture and energy exports” with details to be worked out later.</p>
<p>Focus now swings to which U.S. commodities could benefit as China buys more, and which countries stand to lose business in the world’s biggest market for most raw materials.</p>
<p>Soybeans</p>
<p>The oilseed has been one of the major battlegrounds of the trade war and will very likely feature in the truce. China’s planned tariffs on U.S. exports were seen as a politically charged strike at America’s agricultural heartlands, which had supported Trump’s presidency.</p>
<p>China is the world’s biggest importer of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34f297de78"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span> and America’s largest buyer in trade worth $14 billion last year. While about a third of U.S. production goes to the Asian country annually, China last year bought more of the oilseed from Brazil.</p>
<p>China could potentially increase annual U.S. soy imports to more than 40 million to 50 millions metric tons, according to Li Qiang, chief analyst with Shanghai JC Intelligence Co. It purchased almost 33 million tons from the U.S. last year and 50.9 million from Brazil. Buyers have recently been shunning American supplies due to uncertainty over whether the government would follow through on its planned tariffs. Soybeans on the Chicago Board of Trade climbed more than 2 percent on Monday on news of the truce.</p>
<p>Cotton</p>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-cotton-no.2"" id=""5fc34f297e2e8"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8851"">Cotton</a></span> represents another major trade flow from the U.S.: exports of raw cotton fetched $5.8 billion last year, government data show. China was the top destination after Vietnam. Futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange have surged to a four-year high after bad weather damaged crops in Xinjiang, the top producer, potentially putting pressure on China to import more as stockpiles decline. The country kept its 2018 cotton import quota unchanged at 894,000 tons.</p>
<p>Other U.S. agricultural products that could benefit from increased Chinese imports include sorghum and distillers dried grains, according to Li. Beijing last week scrapped an anti-dumping and anti-subsidy probe into purchases of American sorghum, a trade worth almost $1 billion in 2017.</p>
<p>Ethanol</p>
<p>China could also increase its <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/ethanol-futures"" id=""5fc34f297e432"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""961732"">ethanol</a></span> imports as the government expands its use in vehicles nationwide by 2020, according to Shanghai JC Intelligence. Purchases surged in the first quarter as buyers sought to secure supply ahead of extra tariffs and as expensive domestic corn made imports attractive.</p>
<p>The U.S. accounted for about 86 percent of China’s ethanol imports in the first three months of this year, according to customs data.</p>
<p>LNG</p>
<p>Liquefied <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/natural-gas"" id=""5fc34f297e56a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8862"">natural gas</a></span> is another sector where China and the U.S. can find common ground. The Asian nation is set to become the world’s largest importer of liquefied natural gas in the next decade, and several proposed U.S. export projects are seeking long-term buyers to finance construction. Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasts China’s imports growing to 82 million tons a year by 2030, but the country has long term contracts to supply just 42.5 million tons by then, leaving plenty of space for new purchases.</p>
<p>If China were to fill every drop of uncontracted LNG with U.S. gas, that would amount to about $20 billion a year in purchases by 2030. There are already signs of growing cooperation between the two countries. Earlier this year, China National Petroleum Corp. signed a 25-year deal with Cheniere Energy Inc. to buy U.S. gas. China Petrochemical Corp. has signed a joint development agreement with a proposed export plant in Alaska, and China Gas Holdings Ltd. has agreed to purchase 3 million tons of LNG a year from Delfin LNG’s proposed plant in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>Crude</p>
<p>In the world of crude, the U.S. needs China more than China needs the U.S. The Asian nation is helping drive a surge in exports from the U.S., increasing purchases last year to 224,000 barrels a day, up from just 1,000 in 2015, when Washington lifted restrictions on exports.</p>
<p>For China, the biggest importer of oil in the world, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc34f297e6aa"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">U.S. crude</a></span> is just a small part of its portfolio, with major suppliers like Saudi Arabia and Russia having the biggest shares. China spent $162.3 billion on crude purchases in 2017, with just $3.16 billion of that going to the U.S.</p>
<p>LPG</p>
<p>There’s a lot of room left for China to increase imports of liquefied petroleum gas, fuel that’s used mainly for cooking, heating and transportation. The Asian nation last year bought 3.56 million tons, or about 113,000 barrels a day, from the U.S., worth $1.86 billion, customs data show. Only the U.A.E. supplied more, sending 6.49 million tons worth $3.19 billion.</p>
<p>Still, China’s imports from the U.S. were far lower than total estimated American LPG exports of about 1 million barrels a day in 2017. With shale output still booming and economic growth in the Asian nation showing little sign of slowing down, trade in products such as propane and butane can potentially be boosted. If that happens, other suppliers such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar may lose out on the prized Chinese market.</p>    <div class=""clear""></div>"

There was a mixed bag of news but the effect of the COVID news and the Stock Market and outside markets pressured the grain complex as well.

1606633864-4985,https://www.investing.com/commodities/us-soybeans-opinion/10,"Trump’s Idea Of A Trade War Win: Cheaper Oil, Deeper Fed Cuts",https://www.investing.com/analysis/trumps-idea-of-a-trade-war-win-cheaper-oil-deeper-fed-cuts-200451172,"By Investing.com (Barani Krishnan/Investing.com)CommoditiesAug 06, 2019 04:48AM ET","<p>So, is Donald Trump winning the trade war with China, at least from a commodities perspective?</p>
<p>It might sound like a premature—even odd—question, considering that China just devalued its currency. An appreciable time gap is probably needed to tell how well the Trump administration is managing and firing back at Beijing—although the market impact for the U.S. over the past 24 hours has been nothing short of a disaster.</p>
<p>Still, if you’re wearing a commodities hat like me, you’d probably be asking this anyway, as the U.S. president seems to be getting at least one thing that he wants now: cheap(er) oil.</p>
<p></p><p>Of course, there might be a bigger prize awaiting Trump if the currency market and global market fallout from the trade war persists and recession fears start ratcheting up: The Federal Reserve might be forced to do a second and possibly bigger rate cut within the next month to counter the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-cny"" id=""5fc349449f340"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""2111"">Chinese yuan</a></span>'s move. Even some of the president’s ardent supporters, such as prominent energy markets commentator Phil Fynn, believe Trump’s additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports, beginning on Sept. 1, is designed to force the Fed’s hand.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>This is because the president has made no secret of how he much he loathes the modest <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/fed-interest-rate-decision-168"" id=""5fc349449f9f1"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""168"">25-basis point cut</a></span> announced by the Fed on July 31. While some had hoped for a 50-bp cut last week, it wouldn’t have been inconceivable for the president to have even thought of squeezing a full percentage point out of the central bank in the near term, based on the inordinate pressure he’s been applying on its chairman Jay Powell.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>But Powell has practically shut the door on more cuts for the remainder of the year, describing last week’s action as a one-off “mid-cycle adjustment”. “As usual, Powell let us down,” the president tweeted after the 25-bp cut. On Monday, the United States labelled China a “currency manipulator”, heightening pressure on the Fed to ease. Trump also retrained his tweet gun at Powell, asking: “Are you listening, Federal Reserve? This is a major violation which will greatly weaken (the) China (yuan) over time!”</p>
<h3><strong>Fed-driven Ag Commodities Rally Versus Lower Crude Prices</strong></h3><p></p>
<p></p><p>Another Fed cut could certainly boost prices of raw materials, aside from equities, of course, and would in theory be a win for commodities. But is a commodities rally really what the president desires? Sure U.S. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc349449f627"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybean</a></span> prices could stabilize and even go higher in the event of a rate cut. Despite China’s announcement on Monday that it was freezing U.S. agricultural imports, Chicago soybean prices, which initially fell 1.6%  to June lows, recovered to close little changed. The idea of an impending, and possibly deeper, Fed cut may have aided the recovery. Again, in theory, that’s good for Trump as 80% of farmers in the heartland voted for the president in the 2016 election. And if they get higher prices for their produce, it’s certainly better for him than having to write billions of dollars in subsidy checks to secure their votes again in 2020.</p><p></p>
<p>So, while an ag market recovery is, in theory, good for Trump, those who know the president well also know that the commodity that he’s most passionate about is oil.</p>
<p>History has proven that high oil prices are never too good for a president seeking reelection, and Trump is 15 months away from a hopeful second term.</p>
<p></p><p>Reuters' energy analyst John Kemp noted in a column last year that the rise in benchmark U.S. crude prices from a low of less than $30 a barrel in February 2016 to more than $70 in July 2018 had boosted the economies of Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota and other producing states. But Kemp also noted that most of those states were solidly Republican. He added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""The president, therefore, is paying much closer attention to the harmful impact of higher oil and gasoline prices on consumers in swing states.""</p>
</blockquote><p></p>
<p></p><p>Trump has repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction in the past with how oil prices and production were controlled by OPEC—which, incidentally, has extended until March 2020 its commitment to cut regular output by 1.2 million barrels per day.</p><p></p>
<p></p><h3><strong>Cheaper Oil Hereon?</strong></h3><p></p>
<p>By keeping trade relations with China in a flux, the president, in an odd way, achieves the cheaper prices he seeks on crude, and relatively, gasoline at the pump.</p>

<p>Dominick Chirichella, director of risk and trading at the Energy Management Institute in New York, is in no doubt of the path of lower resistance that lies ahead for oil from the heightened trade war.</p>
<p></p><p>Said Chiricella:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The latest moves by both the U.S. and China are projecting a scenario where oil demand growth is likely to slow more than what has already been forecast.”</p>
</blockquote><p></p>
<p></p><p>He noted that the world’s three leading agencies for energy—the U.S.-based EIA, the Paris-based IEA and the Vienna-based OPEC—will all be releasing their monthly oil forecasts next week, and most market participants expected the trio to lower their reading on global oil demand.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>He added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For the short term it is all about the trade war with the market paying no attention to anything else. Trade headlines will likely be the main market price directional driver for at least the next week or so.”</p>
</blockquote><p></p>
<p></p><p>Even cheaper oil may be coming: Bank of America speculated on Monday that oil could crash to $30 per barrel if China started buying Iranian oil in further retaliation against Trump and his sanctions against Tehran.</p><p></p>
<p>It’s not known yet how much that will please the president, considering the defiance by two of his rivals, despite the cheaper oil he’ll get.</p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

<p><strong>CRUDE OIL</strong> prices have fallen for the past three days despite rumours circulating that OPEC and its allies are planning to cut supply further at its December meeting.

<h2><strong>Precious Metals</strong></h2><p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc34ade2a734"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">GOLD</a></span></strong> has taken a back seat when it comes to demand as the hopes for a breakthrough in the U.S.-China trade negotiations breathe life into risk appetite and reduce the need for safe haven assets. The precious metal has retreated from near four-week highs as demand waned, and failed to close above the 55-day moving average at 1,504 this time around.</p>
<p>Demand is also slowing from the Indian retail sector as last Friday, the traditional, most auspicious day for buying gold in India, passed with sales reportedly down about 20% from a year earlier. High prices and a slowing economy have been blamed for the weak demand.</p>
<p>Speculative investors remain bullish however, increasing net long positions for a third straight week in the week to October 22, CFTC data show. The buying pulled net long positioning from three-month lows.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/silver"" id=""5fc34ade2a816"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8836"">SILVER</a></span></strong> is also under pressure, facing the biggest weekly loss in more than a month, despite the prospects of a Fed rate cut later today and possible pickup in demand if the U.S.-China Phase 1 trade deal is signed. Speculative accounts were net buyers at the last reporting date, lifting net long positioning from an 11 week low. The gold/silver (Mint ratio) has been steady near one-month lows this week.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/palladium"" id=""5fc34ade2a8fa"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8883"">PALLADIUM</a></span></strong> reached a new record high above 1,800 on Monday and has consolidated those gains since. There is a perceived increase in demand for the vital metal used in automobile emissions control units amid more stringent environmental regulations in Europe and China. Speculative investors have had a good run on long positions and some have taken the latest gains as an opportunity to book some profits. Accounts were net sellers for a second consecutive week in the week to October 22, according to the latest data from CFTC.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/platinum"" id=""5fc34ade2a9db"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8910"">PLATINUM</a></span></strong> gains have been limited in comparison and peaked at the end of last week. Last week’s gains were the most since the end of August, but the metal has slid 0.65% so far this week. Speculative investors remain bullish on the metal, having boosted net long positions to the highest since February last year.</p>
<p></p><h2><strong>Base Metals</strong></h2><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/copper"" id=""5fc34ade2aaba"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8831"">COPPER</a></span></strong> prices reached the highest in six weeks yesterday amid hopes that a “mini” U.S.-China trade deal will stir up increased demand for the industrial metal. In addition, supply concerns were heightened after workers at Chile’s ports decided to stop work for two days starting yesterday in a strike protest. Union members also staged three days of stoppages last week.Speculative investors mounted the bull bandwagon in the latest reporting week to October 22, turning net buyers for a second straight week, according to CFTC data. Stocks of copper at warehouses monitored by the London Metal Exchange (LME) as at Monday were the lowest since April.<h2><strong>Agriculturals</strong></h2><p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34ade2ab93"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">SOYBEANS</a></span></strong> look set to fall for a second week after hitting the highest since June 2018 on October 22. Soybeans have fallen 2.5% from that peak but today are facing the first up-day in four days. The 55-day moving average at 8.855 as acting as the next technical support point and prices have traded above that moving average since September 12.</p>
<p>China has said that the terms of the Phase 1 agreement are “basically complete,” suggesting that the deal will be ready for signing by the two leaders at the APEC summit in Chile next month. The U.S. has stated that inspections of soybeans ready for export are up 18% from a week earlier to 1.57 million tons, with about a third heading to China, according to Bloomberg reports.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc34ade2ac69"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">WHEAT</a></span></strong> fell last week for the first time in eight weeks after reaching the highest since June on the back of China’s agreement to buy more U.S. agricultural products as part of the Phase 1 deal. The rally stalled near the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the June-September drop at 5.285.</p>
<p>A recent Bloomberg survey showed U.S. wheat growers are set to plant the least number of acres of wheat in 110 years during this season. Weak prices and better returns for planting corn have been cited for the drop. Speculative investors have increased net long positions to the most since the week of July 30.</p><div class=""outerEleWrapper"">

<p>An uptick in corn feed demand is possible as China’s pork industry recovers from the bout of swine fever that swept through the industry. This could coincide with smaller corn harvests domestically due to unfavourable weather conditions and lend support to corn prices.</p>

        <p>Investing.com - U.S. wheat futures fell for the first time in three sessions on Tuesday, as investors looked ahead to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s closely-watched monthly crop supply and demand report due later in the session.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc344e0068ec"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">US wheat</a></span> for May delivery declined 5.33 cents, or 1.09%, to trade at $4.8488 a bushel during U.S. morning hours.</p>
<p>Market analysts expect the agency to raise its estimate for 2014-15 wheat ending stocks to 699 million bushels, up from a forecast of 692 million bushels in February.</p>
<p>A day earlier, wheat rallied 7.4 cents, or 1.55%, to settle at $4.9000 a bushel as traders returned to the market to seek cheap valuations in wake of recent losses.</p>
<p>Wheat for May delivery touched a contract-low of $4.7840 on March 6 as concerns over ample global supplies and indications of reduced demand for U.S. wheat weighed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc344e006bfa"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">US corn</a></span> for May delivery inched down 1.62 cents, or 0.42%, to trade at $3.8738 a bushel, as weakness in wheat spilled over. Wheat and corn prices are linked because both can be used as animal feed.</p>
<p>US corn for May delivery tacked on 2.6 cents, or 0.71%, on Monday to end at $3.8860.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the Chicago Board of Trade, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc344e006ce7"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">US soybeans</a></span> for May delivery shed 4.28 cents, or 0.43%, to trade at $9.8813 a bushel amid easing concerns over Brazilian export prospects.</p>
<p>Brazil is a major soybean exporter and competes with the U.S. for business on the global market, which could weigh on demand for U.S. supplies.</p>
<p>On Monday, US soybeans for May delivery rose 8.2 cents, or 0.84%, to close at $9.9320 a bushel.</p>
<p>Market participants expect the USDA to cut its forecast for U.S. soybean ending stocks to 376 million bushels, down from last month's estimate of 385 million bushels.</p>
<p>Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, government figures show. Wheat was fourth, behind hay.</p>

<p><strong>Elevated US-China tensions create difficult conditions to reach a <em>real </em>deal. </strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Chinese stocks and the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-cny"" id=""5fc34a35031af"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""2111"">CNY</a></span> gave back gains in sign of caution ahead of the talks. </strong></p>
<p><strong>PRC's 70-year anniversary is celebrated on 1 October. It will be a demonstration of economic achievements as well as military capabilities.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Trump lashes out at China again in UN speech </strong></p>
<p><em>""They want to make a deal very badly... It could happen sooner than you think </em>"". The <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-trump/trump-says-trade-deal-with-china-could-happen-sooner-than-people-think-idUSKBN1WA1Z4"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-auth=""NotApplicable""> comment </a>came from US President Donald Trump on Wednesday and got a positive spin in some media. However, looking at what he said in the same session made it look less positive: <em>""You know they want to make a deal and they should want to make a deal. The question is, do we want to make a deal?"" </em></p>
<p>The day before he lashed out at China in a speech in the UN. He proclaimed he would not accept a <em>""bad deal </em>"" and in blunt terms stated that <em>""not only has China declined to adopt promised reforms, it has embraced an economic model dependent on massive market barriers, heavy state subsidies, currency manipulation, product dumping, forced technology transfers and the theft of intellectual property and also trade secrets on a grand scale. </em>"" Trump also said the US was watching the situation in Hong Kong carefully.</p>
<p>China rebuked the speech through state media and foreign minister Wang Yi said in a speech in New York, that <em>""negotiation cannot take place under threat at the expense of China's legitimate right to development </em>"". Wang also said <em>""seeking hegemony is not in our DNA </em>"" and that China has <em>""no intention to play the Game of Thrones </em>"" on the world stage. China strongly <a href=""http://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201909/26/WS5d8c0b0fa310cf3e3556d831.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-auth=""NotApplicable""> condemns </a>what they see as US meddling in domestic affairs in Hong Kong. Referring to this issue foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a press conference that <em>""any move made by Washington to undermine China's interests will receive a forceful fight back from Beijing."" </em></p>
<p></p>
<p>On a more positive note, this week China has resumed buying <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34a3503593"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span> from the US on a limited scale and the US exempted 400 goods from tariffs.</p>
<p><strong>Comment: </strong>We believe both sides are interested to strike an interim trade deal, where China buys agricultural products like <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34a35036cd"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">US soybeans</a></span> and pork and Trump postpones some tariff increases (see our weekly last week). However, the overall atmosphere between the two countries is far from good and it leaves difficult conditions to strike any bigger deal. The hands of China's negotiators are tied by domestic resistance to go any further than where it ended in May. And Trump and his team, led by China hawk Robert Lighthizer, is sticking to demands that China cannot accept. Hence, the deadlock and why there are no signs the two sides are any closer to a real deal. Maybe it changes when we get closer to the US election and Trump is more eager to strike a deal. But for now it seems too early for that.</p>
<p><strong>Chinese stocks and CNY give up gains</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Chinese stock market lost some steam this week following a strong August and early September. We believe it reflects profit taking and hesitancy ahead of the crucial trade talks in October. An interim deal should be positive for stocks as it dampens the risk of further escalation. On the other hand, a failure to reach an interim deal could result in higher US tariffs on 15 October (as scheduled), which would be a reminder of the difficulty of striking a deal. It would also reignite fears of further escalation. The CNY also gave up some of the gains seen lately (chart on front page). It was partly also due to overall USD strength as it is usual for <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-cny"" id=""5fc34a35037be"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""2111"">USD/CNY</a></span> to move higher when the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/us-dollar-index"" id=""5fc34a35038cc"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8827"">USD index</a></span> increases as has been the case this week. While growth has also softened in the US, it is still the strongest pillar in the global economy, which is reflected in more USD strength.</p>
<p>Comment: We expect the Chinese stock market to continue to trade without clear direction in the coming months. Investors are sitting on the fence to find out whether we are heading for a full-blown trade war and recession, or a trade deal that would most likely lead to an economic recovery and give a boost to markets. We are still positive on Chinese stocks in the medium to long term as we expect the economy to weather the trade war storm and eventually get back on its feet during 2020. When it comes to <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-cny"" id=""5fc34a3503a01"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""2111"">USD/CNY</a></span>, we look for more range trading around 7.10-7.20 in the short term. We still project the cross at 7.20 on a 12M horizon as our baseline scenario is no deal before the November 2020 US election. But also no material escalation of the trade war.</p>
<p><strong>China celebrates 70-year anniversary of the People’s Republic</strong></p>
<p>On Tuesday next week, Beijing will host a comprehensive celebration of the 70-year anniversary of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). On 1 October 1949, the first leader of PRC, Mao Zedong, proclaimed the founding of the Republic. It followed victory of the Communists over the Nationalists (KMT) following many years of civil war.</p>
<p>Comment: The celebration will illustrate China’s pride over its economic achievements over the past decades as well as underlining China’s increased military power. A parade is said to reveal new military equipment. It will show to the Chinese people and the world that China is determined to never again experience a ‘century of humiliation’ as was the case from 1840-1949, when among other things, some parts of China were occupied by foreign forces and China was forced to sign ‘unequal trade treaties’. In a speech China’s President is set to repeat the goal of Chinese rejuvenation in the decades to come and thus achieving the Chinese Dream. But he will probably also repeat that China does not aim for hegemony but will work for a multipolar world. In the US; the day will be another reminder that China is on a steadily rising path – both economically and militarily.</p>

        <p>Investing.com - U.S. corn futures fell to the lowest level in more than five months on Friday, amid indications of rapid planting progress in the U.S. Midwest.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc345db864fd"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">US corn</a></span> for May delivery hit a session low of $3.6360 a bushel, a level not seen since November 20, before closing at $3.6440, down 6.2 cents, or 1.69%.</p>
<p>For the week, the May corn contract lost 15.13 cents, or 3.95%, the biggest weekly decline in 12 weeks as forecasts for drier weather across the Midwest was expected to further aid planting of the crop.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, approximately 9% of the corn crop was planted as of April 19, up from just 2% in the preceding week and above the 6% planted during the same week a year earlier.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc345db868ab"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">US wheat</a></span> for May delivery slumped 11.6 cents, or 2.36%, to settle at $4.8600 a bushel on Friday. Earlier in the session, wheat slumped to $4.8500, the lowest level since March 10.</p>
<p>On the week, the May wheat contract dropped 7.5 cents, or 1.37%, the third straight weekly loss, as dry weather conditions in key U.S. wheat-growing states was expected to benefit crop conditions.</p>
<p>The USDA said that the U.S. winter wheat crop was rated 42% good to excellent as of last week. Approximately 34% of the crop was in good to excellent condition in the same week a year earlier.</p>
<p>The agency also said that 36% of the spring wheat crop was planted as of last week, up from 17% in the preceding week. Only 9% of the crop was planted in the same week a year earlier, while the five-year average for this time of year is 19%.</p>

For the week, the May soybean contract tacked on 1.0 cent, or 0.16%.</p>
<p>Gains were limited amid optimism over the outlook for supplies in South America. Brazil and Argentina are major soybean exporters and compete with the U.S. for business on the global market.</p>
<p>Large South American crop prospects could weigh on demand for U.S. supplies.</p>

A second day rebound for the indices, despite mounting virus cases, could be flagging a possible win for President Donald Trump’s reelection bid.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the USD slipped lower this morning, which <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/news/forex-news/dollar-slips-back-election-positioning-noted-rba-eases-2339297"" id=""5fc34de433367"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""oal"" data-articleid=""2339297"">some see</a></span> as ""net-short positioning ahead of the U.S. vote"" suggesting ""the dollar is somewhat less protected on the downside in the event of a Blue wave"" in anticipation of a Biden victory.</p><h2><strong>Global Financial Affairs</strong></h2><p>U.S. stocks have been a statistical indicator for presidential outcomes since 1928, based on whether they are up or down within the three months prior to an election and have provided <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/analysis/week-ahead-volatility-expected-amid-myriad-elections-uncertainties-200543067"" id=""5fc34de42e447"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""pal"" data-articleid=""200543067"">100% accuracy</a></span> since 1984 on an incumbent's chances. On Monday, stocks closed back in positive territory, which might signal a Trump victory, just as in 2016 they declined prior to the elections, foreshadowing the loss of Democratic candidate Hilary Clinton (then the incumbent party).</p>
<p>Of course, anything can actually happen.</p>
<p>This morning, the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/stoxx-600"" id=""5fc34de42b38a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""40823"">Stoxx Europe 600</a></span> Index opened higher and extended a recovery rally from a five-month low to its third day. Growth-sensitive cyclical stocks like oil and gas providers along with miners and bank shares led the gains. French international banking group BNP Paribas SA (PA:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/bnp-paribas"" id=""5fc34de42b473"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""396"">BNPP</a></span>) surged 4.6% after posting a profit beat thanks to accelerated trading revenue.</p>
<p>Earlier, during the Asian session, regional indices finished firmly in green territory, with most major benchmarks closer to a 2% gain. Australia’s <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/aus-200"" id=""5fc34de42b56b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""171"">ASX 200</a></span>, Hong Kong's <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/hang-sen-40"" id=""5fc34de42b640"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""179"">Hang Seng</a></span> and South Korea’s <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/kospi"" id=""5fc34de42b70c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""37426"">KOSPI</a></span> led the gainers.</p>
<p>For Australian markets, it was the best session in almost a month after the country’s central bank <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/rba-interest-rate-decision-171"" id=""5fc34de4321ae"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""171"">trimmed interest rates</a></span> and launched QE. South Korean shares gained the most in almost five months as the local mood was positively influenced by strong factory output data from major economies, including the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/ism-manufacturing-pmi-173"" id=""5fc34de4322a3"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""173"">U.S.</a></span>, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/caixin-manufacturing-pmi-753"" id=""5fc34de43238a"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""753"">China</a></span> and the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/manufacturing-pmi-201"" id=""5fc34de432450"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""201"">eurozone</a></span>, easing concerns about another recession amid the continuing global pandemic resurgence.</p>
<p>Ironically, despite’s China data “<a href=""https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-markets-today-shares-rise-ahead-of-us-election-after-china-factory-boom-2020-11-1029752345"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">soothing some nerves</a>” ahead of the uncertain U.S. election, the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/shanghai-composite"" id=""5fc34de42b7ef"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""40820"">Shanghai Composite</a></span> lagged, (+1.4%), while Japan was closed for a holiday.</p>
<p>Yesterday, American equities rebounded from their worst slump since before the March lows, as dip buyers sought bargains in energy, materials and industrials shares, hoping Tuesday's election would finally remove the current primary risk to markets—the ongoing anxiety regarding what the next government might look like.</p>

<p>The return of risk-on appetites also prompted investors to sell off Treasuries.</p>

<p>While the precious metal bounced off the bullish wedge, it has to invalidate the rising, bearish flag—whose bottom is naturally drawn by the 100 DMA, which is itself a downside breakout of a bearish triangle. Its trajectory going forward will also likely be driven by <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/analysis/gold-and-the-us-election-what-to-look-for-200543297"" id=""5fc34de4312ae"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""pal"" data-articleid=""200543297"">fundamentals</a></span>; it's viewed as a safe haven hedge against rising uncertainty, something in greater abundance right now.</p>

<p>The two-day jump, with prices closing strong at the top of the session, creates a quandary for traders: as WTI reentered a range after crossing back above the 200 DMA, they increase the chances of a return to $42, if prices don’t fall back below $37.

<p>Here we'll take a closer look at key principals of investing in commodities futures through ETFs as well as a commodities ETF to consider:</p><h2><strong>'Rolling-Over': What It Means, Why It Matters</strong><strong><br></strong></h2><p>Most commodity exchange-traded funds own futures contracts—contracts for future delivery, but not the physical commodity itself.</p>
<p>However, investors should note that future contracts expire every month, so stocks trade in perpetuity. Yet, futures contracts have expiration dates. So to avoid physical delivery at contract expiry, these funds replace expiring contracts with new contracts that end later, a process known as “rolling-over.""</p>
<p>Two other key terms to note are ""contango” and “backwardation.”</p>
<p>When a market is in contango, the forward price of a futures contract is higher than the current spot price.&nbsp;Contango causes commodity ETFs based on a futures contract to incur a roll-over loss.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when a market is in backwardation, the forward price of the futures contract is lower than the spot price. In that case, there would not be a roll-over loss, but rather a roll-over gain.</p>
<p>Rolling-over into new contracts can be done in a range of ways involving different combinations of futures contracts that a fund can choose from. Rolling-over costs change daily.</p>
<p>Due to this cost structure, returns of such commodity funds can differ from physical commodity prices. Negative roll yields typically decrease returns over time.</p><h2><strong>1. Invesco Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Strategy No K-1 ETF </strong></h2><ul>

Other holdings include<strong> NY Harbor ULSD, Natural Gas </strong>and <strong>Silver.</strong></p>
<p>Year-to-date, the fund is down over 16%.</p>
<p>Commodity price changes mostly depend on supply and demand dynamics. For example, during a cold winter, as the demand for<strong> <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/natural-gas"" id=""5fc34d15e6d0f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8862"">natural gas</a></span></strong> increases, so do prices. Commodity prices also usually move higher during inflationary periods, as they are widely considered a hedge against inflation.</p>
<p>Historically, there has been a negative correlation between commodities and stocks. Academic research shows that by investing in commodity futures or ETFs based on these contracts, market participants may be able to decrease the volatility of an all-stock portfolio without reducing their expected return. Thus, investors who are interested in diversifying into commodities may consider researching the fund further.</p><h3><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h3><p>Diversification is a fundamental principle of long-term portfolio construction. Therefore, holding commodities as part of an asset-allocation strategy may be appropriate.</p>
<p>However, most commodity ETFs differ from traditional ETFs in a significant way: they typically use futures contracts. As a result, over time, these funds' returns may deviate substantially from the change of the spot price of the underlying commodity. Therefore, it is important to fully understand the potential risk/return profiles before investing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, in the U.S., there is a range of commodity ETF structures. So investors may want to ask their accountants about various tax implications of investing in these ETFs.</p>

<!--end-image--><p>The Wall Street Journal reports <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/us-china-confirm-reaching-phase-one-trade-deal-11576234325"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">U.S., China Agree to Limited Deal to Halt Trade War</a>.</p>
<p></p><blockquote><p>The limited agreement, capping months of sometimes-testy negotiations, calls for China to purchase more products from American farmers and other exports, U.S. officials said. In return, the U.S. put the brakes on new tariffs set to take effect Sunday and agreed to reduce some existing levies. Both sides termed it a “phase one” deal and said negotiations would continue on remaining issues.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump called the deal “phenomenal” and told reporters in the Oval Office that the U.S. would continue to use the remaining tariffs as leverage in future negotiations with China.</p>
<p>“I say affectionately that the farmers are going to have to go out and buy much larger tractors because it means a lot of business, a tremendous amount of business,” Mr. Trump said.</p>
<p>But doubts remained, with some critics claiming the deal amounted to little more than China agreeing to step up U.S. farm purchases and not make the kind of long-term economic changes that U.S. officials have said are needed to level the playing field for businesses.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, the U.S. canceled plans to impose fresh tariffs on $156 billion in annual imports of Chinese-made goods—including smartphones, toys and consumer electronics—that were set to go into effect Sunday. The U.S. will also slash the tariff rate in half on roughly $120 billion of goods affected on Sept. 1, from 15% to 7.5%.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Can't Look Under the Hood</strong></p>
<p>OK. China will buy some more <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34bf4eb3c7"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span>, but probably no more than they were buying before. In return, Trump phases out some tariffs. Otherwise it's top secret. Shhhh.</p>
<p>Neither government submitted a full text or even a detailed summary of the deal, hamstringing efforts to determine the winners and losers in the world’s two biggest economies or the quality of the agreement.</p>
<p><strong>Disagreement Over the Non-Details</strong></p>
<p>Although we have no details because the deal is a secret, we already have disagreements regarding the what's under the hood.</p>
<p>Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen, one of China’s lead negotiators, said the U.S. had agreed to remove the remaining tariffs on Chinese products “in stages.” Mr. Lighthizer said there was no agreement on that, and suggested China believes further reductions could be negotiated in subsequent phases of the deal.</p>
<p><strong>No Guarantees</strong></p>
<p>Guarantees violate WTO rules, so, whatever is under the hood, guarantees cannot be part of it.</p>
<p>Chinese negotiators, led by Mr. Liu, President Xi Jinping’s point man on U.S. trade, balked at guaranteeing the purchases for fear that such managed trade could violate the rules of the World Trade Organization and cause friction between China and its other trading partners.</p>
<p>“China has yet to confirm this pledge or provide any details on how they will meet it,” said Brian Kuehl co-executive director of Farmers for Free Trade, which backs removing tariffs and opening markets. “There are rightfully many doubts about the president’s claim that China will purchase $50 billion in ag products in a single year—more than twice the level of pre-trade war annual purchases.”</p>
<p><strong>US Agrees to Buy More Ag Products From China</strong></p>
<p>China will not disclose it's actual commitment. And the U.S won't do so either. But this line caught my eye.</p>
<p></p><blockquote>Chinese officials, declining to specify how much China expects to buy from the U.S. as part of the near-term deal, also said <em>the U.S. <strong>had agreed to increase its imports of Chinese agricultural products</strong></em>.</blockquote><p>This is hard to digest without specifics, but it appears China will buy more soybeans if the U.S. will buy more baby food, water chestnuts, or dog food.</p>
<p></p><h3><strong>Urgent Task</strong></h3>Liao Min, China’s Vice Finance Minister and a trusted aide to Mr. Liu, the chief negotiator, said: “The urgent task right now is to get the phase-one agreement signed and implemented.”Silly me. I thought the urgent task was to keep everyone from looking under the hood.Of course, that presumes there is a car.<h3><strong>No Mystery on One Key Idea</strong></h3><!--start-image-->

<p></p><p>While the drought sent grain prices soaring, the squeeze on yields and harvests were bad for farmers and consumers, as corn, soybean and wheat crops in the United States — the largest world exporter of those key crops — lay baking in fields, losing yield potential daily or being plowed under for insurance claims.</p><p></p>
<p></p><h2 dir=""ltr"">Grains Traded At Their Highest This Decade During The 2012 Drought </h2>
<p>At the height of the 2012 drought, soybeans traded near $17.89 a bushel, wheat at almost $9.44 and corn near $8.44.<br><br>Ever the catalyst of market unpredictability, Trump sent soybeans to 10-year lows of around $7.91 per bushel in May this year as the U.S. trade war with China peaked. Until the trade spat really took hold in the summer of 2018, China had been purchasing more than half of all of its soybeans from the United States.<br><br></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img title=""U.S. Soybeans Futures Monthly Chart"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic5e4935779e9ee0a5e72bb1cc1ed5df50.png"" alt=""U.S. Soybeans Futures Monthly Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">U.S. Soybeans Futures Monthly Chart</span></div></div></div><br><br>As China put up retaliatory tariffs of its own against the U.S. last year, Chinese imports of U.S. soy reached zero in August, September and October 2018.<br><br>A year down the road, things have gotten better for U.S. soy, with the Chinese rolling back their tariffs in a gesture that seems to indicate that a trade deal might be happening. Soybean futures traded in Chicago have recovered lately to around $9.41 per bushel.<p></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr"">No Certainty Over Soybeans Till China Trade Deal Is Signed</h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>Yet, until the trade deal is signed, demand for U.S. soy isn’t exactly out of the woods yet. <br><br>With persistent reports about the Chinese being unhappy with Trump’s condition that Beijing commit in advance to buying $50 billion of U.S. farm products a year, there is no knowing what the compromise will be. <br><br>And the longer it takes for the deal to be signed, the more uncertainty for the soy trade, particularly with how Trump, who’s seeking reelection in November, will react.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>Since talk began ramping up at end-October of a potential U.S.-China deal, China's monthly purchase of U.S. soybeans has more than doubled to 2.6 million tons in November. Still, Brazil remains China's biggest soy supplier, with 3.9 million tons imported last month. </p><p></p>
<p>China has also been ramping up soy imports from Russia. Last week, Russian media reported that the country is delivering soybeans to China by train for the first time, according to Chinese agriculture database CoFeed. State-owned enterprise China Oil and Food Corporation (COFCO) will receive 250 tons of Russian soybeans this month.</p>
<p>U.S. and Chinese officials have said they will begin negotiations on the second phase of their trade deal immediately after the first is concluded. Even so, Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson Gao Feng said last week that Beijing ""firmly opposed"" the U.S. National Defense Authorization Act, which Trump signed into law this month.</p>
<p>China was mentioned 202 times in that legislation and U.S. lawmakers plan to confront China on a variety of threats and concerns, including sanctions on Chinese companies, Chinese efforts to infiltrate U.S. universities and research institutions and China's Belt and Road Initiative. The act also makes it tougher to lift sanctions on telecom giant Huawei.</p>
<p></p><h2 dir=""ltr"">China Continues To Bristle At U.S. Intervention In “Normal Company Operations”</h2>
<p>The defense act's ""restrictions on purchasing Chinese products and Chinese companies' exports are bad examples of government intervention into companies' normal operation and activities, which is the opposite of the U.S.'s values of free and fair trade. It harms international trade and global industry chain,"" Gao said. ""China will closely monitor NDAA's impacts on Chinese companies and take necessary measures to protect Chinese companies' rights.""<br><br>Aside from the disruption to the soybeans trade, Trump also upset the corn lobby a week ago by giving the upper hand to oil refiners in their bid to reduce the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/ethanol-futures"" id=""5fc34c25ab7e6"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""961732"">ethanol</a></span> content in gasoline. </p>
<h2 dir=""ltr"">Corn Hovering Near 3-Month Lows As Trump Upsets Ethanol Lobby</h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>Corn is hovering near 3-month lows of around $3.89 per bushel, though that is still markedly higher than the six-year low of $3.01 hit in August 2016 from a global glut in corn supplies that year.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>The Trump administration finalized U.S. biofuel blending requirements for 2020 last week, leaving a key part of the rule unchanged from an earlier proposal that the corn lobby had criticized as inadequate to help struggling farmers.<br><br></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img title=""U.S. Corn Futures Monthly Chart"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic239ca3334dc874f666b38298f271f751.png"" alt=""U.S. Corn Futures Monthly Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">U.S. Corn Futures Monthly Chart</span></div></div></div><p></p><p></p>
<p>The move is destined to anger biofuel industry officials and corn-state senators who had pushed hard for changes until the 11th hour, potentially threatening President Donald Trump’s support among farmers ahead of next year’s election.</p>
<p>Under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), the Environmental Protection Agency is charged with setting biofuel blending requirements for the refining industry to help farmers by boosting demand for corn- and soybean-based fuels, while reducing U.S. dependence on <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc34c25ab8dd"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">oil</a></span>.</p>
<p>The finalized rule increases the volume for blending requirements to 20.09 billion gallons in 2020, up from 19.92 billion gallons in 2019. The mandate included 15 billion gallons of conventional biofuels like ethanol, unchanged from 2019.</p>
<p>Trump and top White House officials directly intervened in discussions about the biofuel requirements this fall in an attempt to appease farmers, whose support Trump is counting on in November’s presidential election.</p>
<p>“Apparently President Trump doesn’t care about his promise to Iowa’s farmers,” said Iowa Corn Growers Association President Jim Greif, adding that the lobby “will not stop fighting for market access for corn in all forms.”</p>
<p></p><h2 dir=""ltr"">President Denigrates Wheat, Hurting Farmers </h2><p></p>
<p>As for wheat, during the summer, Trump made derisive remarks about U.S.  sales of the grain to Japan, describing wheat as a poor trade exchange for the cars the Japanese sold to the United States.</p>
<p></p><p>The Trump administration did get a trade agreement with Tokyo earlier this month that paves the way for cheaper American beef and other agricultural products to Japan. Tokyo, in return, won cuts in U.S. tariffs for certain manufactured goods, such as machine tools and musical instruments.</p>
<p>And wheat prices are at near 2-½-year highs of $5.58 per bushel now because of drought again — this time in Australia and Russia.  </p>
<p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img title=""U.S. Wheat Futures Monthly Chart"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picf6bd9bfd0e31c570d650da1aee18a53e.png"" alt=""U.S. Wheat Futures Monthly Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">U.S. Wheat Futures Monthly Chart</span></div></div></div><p></p><p></p>
<p></p><p>Yet, when Trump made his remarks about wheat in August, the market was at around three-month lows of around $4.56 per bushel, prompting The Oregon Wheat Growers League to say it was “profoundly disappointed” with the president.</p><p></p>
<p>“We appreciate many of the things that the Trump administration has done for agriculture, but we sincerely hope that the President will take the time to learn about and appreciate the great success story and heritage that has been built between wheat growers in the U.S. and our customers in Japan,” the League said in a statement.</p>
<p>It suggested total ignorance on Trump’s part of the relationships between Japanese millers and U.S. farmers that began in 1949, when a trade delegation was set up to investigate the expansion of wheat sales.</p>
<p></p><p>Since then, Japan has become the No. 1 market for U.S. wheat and the No. 2 market for soft white wheat grown in the Pacific Northwest, the League said. U.S. wheat has a 50% market share in Japan.</p><p></p>
<p>“Our customers in Japan don’t buy our wheat because they are doing us a favor or to make us feel good, they buy our wheat because we have built a relationship with them, earned their trust, listened to their needs, and provided great customer service,” the organization stated.</p>
<p>“This is not a situation in which they’re simply buying what can be close to $1 billion worth of wheat a year for political reasons,” added Steve Mercer, vice president of communications for U.S. Wheat Associates, the overseas marketing arm for the industry. “This is a need and a desire on the part of their industry to purchase U.S. wheat.”</p>
<p>Japan has purchased an average of 2.91 million metric tons in each of the last five years, Mercer said.</p>
<p>Chandler Goule, CEO of the National Association of Wheat Growers, also described Trump’s comments as “very frustrating.” </p>
<p>Goule added:</p>
<p></p><blockquote>“The President claims to be continually supporting farmers, but started a trade war, and then directly attacks the bread basket commodity of the United States.”</blockquote><p></p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

<li>The processing spread in soybeans rises to its highest level in two years</li>
<li>Chinese demand for soybeans rises despite trade tensions with the US</li>
<li>An almost perfect bullish storm for soybeans?</li>
</ul><p>Over the past few years, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34dd497a7c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span> have been the agricultural commodity squarely in the crosshairs of the trade war between the United States and China. After reaching a high of $10.71 per bushel in February 2018, the futures price of the oilseed that trades on the CME’s CBOT division fell to a low of $7.8050 in May 2019.</p>
<p>The US is the world’s leading producer and exporter of soybeans. Since China historically purchases one-quarter of the annual US crop, the trade spat created a glut of the oilseeds in the United States.</p>
<p>The fundamental equation for soybeans and all agricultural products is an expanding demand component. According to the US Census Bureau, each quarter, the global population grows by approximately twenty million people. The supply side depends on the weather conditions in critical growing regions.</p>
<p>In 2012, a drought lifted the price of nearby soybean futures to a record of $17.9475 per bushel. Over the past eight years, the weather cooperated with crop production, leading to bumper crops of soybeans and plenty of product to meet global requirements. But the trade war weighed on the price of the oilseeds.</p>
<p>After reaching the low in May 2019, soybean futures traded sideways with the price remaining below $9.50 per bushel until August 2020. Since then, the commodity has taken off to the upside, rising above the February 2018 high in October, during the current harvest season.</p><h2><strong>Soybeans break out to the upside</strong></h2><p>Soybean futures on the CME’s CBOT division have been making higher lows and higher highs since April when the price of November beans traded to a low of $8.3575 per bushel. The continuous contract hit bottom at $8.0825, which was the low for 2020. </p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img title=""Soybeans Weekly"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic390941fe89e3fb60c44c1f3268472038.png"" alt=""Soybeans Weekly""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Soybeans Weekly</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p><em>Source, all charts: CQG</em></p>
<p>As the weekly chart above shows, last week, soybean futures traded to the most recent high of $10.94 on the continuous contract. The high on January futures was at $10.8850 on Oct. 27.</p>
<p>The oilseed traded above the first level of technical resistance at $10.71, the March 2018 high, taking the commodity to the highest level since July 2016. The open interest metric climbed with the price, typically a technical validation of a bullish trend in a futures market.</p>
<p>Price momentum and relative strength indicators rose near overbought conditions. Weekly historical volatility at 24.21% is close to the high for 2020. The move in the price of soybeans was significant as it came at the end of this year’s harvest season.</p><h2><strong>Crush spreads reflect demand for soybean products</strong></h2><p>Soybeans are a staple source of nutrition. Processors crush the raw oilseed into soybean meal and soybean oil. The meal is a primary input in animal feed, while the oil has applications for cooking and is an ingredient in salad dressings, mayonnaise, and many other foods.</p>
<p>When the crush spread rises, it reflects increasing demand for soybeans. When it falls, it is a sign of oversupply or falling requirements.</p>
<p>The crush spread reflects the processing margin, just as crack spreads represent the demand for gasoline and distillate products in the crude oil market. Processing spreads are an integral part of a commodity’s market structure as they provide clues about the state of the supply and demand equation.</p><h3><strong>The processing spread in soybeans rises to its highest level in two years</strong></h3><p>The move in the soybean crush spread has been highly supportive of the bullish price action in the oilseed futures. </p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img title=""Synthetic Soybean Crush Futures"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic476be72f3f59f21766d220cf9326f855.png"" alt=""Synthetic Soybean Crush Futures""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Synthetic Soybean Crush Futures</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p>As the chart of the soybean crush spread shows, the processing margin rose from 54.25 cents in June to the latest high of $1.50 last week. The move higher in the spread means that soybean product prices outperformed the raw oilseed even though soybean futures prices rose over the past months. The crush spread moved to the highest level since October 2018, which has been bullish for the soybean price.</p><h3><strong>Chinese demand for soybeans rises despite trade tensions with the US</strong></h3><p>Over the past weeks, China has made several “<a href=""https://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/16958-despite-huge-purchases-of-us-soybeans-china-may-not-meet-commitments"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">huge purchases</a>” of US soybeans. The purchases reflect China’s efforts to meet its import commitments under the “<em>phase one</em>” trade agreement signed in January 2020.</p>
<p>The Chinese have been rebuilding their hog population after it was ravaged by African Swine Fever in 2019, which has increased the demand for animal feed and soybean meal. The USDA recently reported 2020/2021 soybean export sales to China totaling 19.241 million tons as of Sept. 17, compared with only 2.0549 million tons by the same date for delivery in 2019/2020. Over ten million tons of outstanding sales to “unknown destinations” could be heading for China.</p>
<p>The trade war caused China to turn to Brazil for the bulk of its soybean requirements. However, Brazil is now entering the new crop year. With COVID-19 raging in the South American country and the weather a critical factor, China may need to purchase even more beans from the US over the coming months despite the ongoing trade frictions.</p><h3><strong>An almost perfect bullish storm for soybeans?</strong></h3><p>If the weather below the equator over the coming weeks and months does not cooperate, soybean futures could be heading a lot higher. Meanwhile, overall weakness in the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/us-dollar-index"" id=""5fc34dd497e1d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8827"">US dollar</a></span>, unprecedented central bank liquidity, and the prospects for more government stimulus over the coming months increase the money supply and weigh on the value of the dollar and other fiat currencies. As the purchasing power of the foreign exchange instruments declines, the potential for higher commodity prices rises, and soybeans are no exception.</p>
<p>Soybeans have been making higher lows and higher highs over the past months. After breaking out above critical technical resistance at the $10.71 level, the next upside target stands at the June 2016 high of $12.0850 per bushel.</p>
<p>The January futures contract settled at the $10.5625 level last Friday. The oilseed price pulled back at the end of October, but the bullish trend remains intact.</p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

        <p>Investing.com - U.S. soybean futures fell for the fifth consecutive session on Wednesday to hit a more than one-week low as improving crop prospects in the U.S. Midwest weighed.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34744ebe77"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">US soybeans</a></span> for August delivery fell to an intraday low of $9.8763 a bushel, the weakest level since June 30, before trading at $9.8850 during U.S. morning hours, down 3.1 cents, or 0.31%.</p>
<p>A day earlier, prices of the oilseed lost 30.2 cents, or 2.96%, to close at $9.9200 as concerns over the global economy dampened the demand outlook.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, nearly 63% of the soybean crop was in good to excellent condition as of July 5, above market expectations.</p>
<p>Soybean emergence was 93% complete, improving from 89% a week earlier, while 21% of the crop bloomed, up from 8% in the preceding week.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc34744ec0ba"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">US wheat</a></span> for September delivery slumped 8.48 cents, or 1.45%, to trade at $5.7612 a bushel early on Wednesday. Wheat dropped 10.2 cents, or 1.72%, on Tuesday to end at $5.8520.</p>
<p>Wheat has been under pressure this week as drier weather across the U.S. grain belt is expected to boost harvest prospects.</p>
<p>Nearly 55% of the U.S. winter-wheat crop was harvested as of July 5, according to the USDA, up from 38% a week earlier. Approximately 55% of the crop was harvested in the same week last year, while the five-year average for this time of year is 59%.</p>
<p>About 40% of the U.S. winter-wheat crop was rated good to excellent as of last week, down from 41% in the preceding week. The agency also said that nearly 70% of the spring-wheat crop was in good to excellent condition, compared to 72% a week earlier.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the Chicago Board of Trade, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc34744ec18d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">US corn</a></span> for September delivery shed 2.75 cents, or 0.65%, to trade at $4.2025 a bushel in early trade on Wednesday. On Tuesday, corn dipped 3.2 cents, or 0.76%, to settle at $4.2320.</p>
<p>Dry weather after excessive rains across the U.S. Midwest is forecast to aid crop conditions and boost the quality of the harvest.</p>
<p>Approximately 69% of the U.S. corn crop was in good to excellent condition as of July 5, up from 68% in the preceding week and above market forecasts.</p>
<p>Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, government figures show. Wheat was fourth, behind hay.</p>

        <i class=""imgGrad"" style=""visibility: visible;""></i>
    
    </div>
        <p>(Bloomberg) -- There are signs of growing frustration among GOP lawmakers with Donald Trump as he moves forward with new trade tariffs, though they’re not ready to rein in the president’s power.</p>
<p>House Speaker Paul Ryan, who rarely directly criticizes Trump, said tariffs “are not the solution,” and warned that pulling out of trade pacts -- as the president did with the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- threatens the U.S. economy. But the most searing comments came later in the day from Senator Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who isn’t running for re-election and is often critical of the president.</p>
<p>“Protectionism is something he’s come back to like a homing pigeon,” Flake told reporters. “I mean, there are very few principles that he sticks with and that’s one of them.""</p>
<p>The Senate on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved a symbolic motion backing a role for Congress in requiring tariffs on national security grounds, such as those Trump imposed on steel and aluminum imports and is considering on autos. That came after the administration’s latest threat to impose tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese-made products on top of levies in effect, or soon to be implemented, on $50 billion of goods.</p>
<p>But many Republicans have said they want to give Trump leeway to see if his approach works, or persuade him privately to back down, instead of restricting his power to impose tariffs. Republicans’ desire to act may grow in coming weeks if the tariffs, and retaliatory measures, begin to increase consumer prices ahead of November’s congressional elections that will determine control of the House and Senate.</p>
<p>Flake said he thinks it’ll take another month for GOP lawmakers to approve legislation as Trump’s approach fails.</p>
<p>""Anybody who’s looking for some genius behind this curtain somehow is going to be disappointed,"" Flake said. ""I don’t know why my colleagues think there’s something behind that curtain. There just isn’t.""</p>
<p>Tariffs aren’t taking much of a toll on the economy -- so far. A lull in U.S. consumer inflation in June may prove temporary, as tariffs begin to take effect. The latest round of China tariffs would boost the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/core-cpi-736"" id=""5fc34f4f4ee0c"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""736"">core Consumer Price Index</a></span> by as much as 0.6 percent within a year, according to Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics.</p>
<p>The impact of earlier tariffs on washing machines is already showing in a pocket of the CPI data. The index for laundry equipment was up 13.1 percent from a year earlier, a record in figures going back to the 1970s, though its effect on the broader CPI is negligible.</p>
<p>Farm Impact</p>
<p>Farm states, which overwhelmingly supported Trump in the 2016 election, are poised to take a hit. China slapped tariffs on a variety of American farm goods that went into effect earlier this month in retaliation for Trump’s duties.</p>
<p>A U.S. Agriculture Department report released Thursday, the first that takes account of recent tariffs on American farm goods forecast that soybean stockpiles will be 51 percent higher next year than had been expected a month earlier as China cuts imports and Brazil gobbles up market share.</p>
<p>The expected drop in the price of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34f4f4e987"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybean</a></span>, the second-most-valuable U.S. crop, would translate to a loss of almost $3.2 billion for soybean farmers. It could be more if the trade war escalates and addition tariffs are imposed.</p>
<p>Economic concerns are starting to weigh on lawmakers.</p>
<p>No Plan</p>
<p>At a Foreign Relations Committee hearing on tariffs Thursday, Senators said they couldn’t understand the administration’s trade strategy or how it plans to obtain improved trading terms with other countries.</p>
<p>""It is pretty apparent we don’t have a stated plan from a marketing or business standpoint,"" said Senator Johnny Isakson, a Georgia Republican. ""We are going to be in a terrible situation because we don’t have a plan.""</p>
<p>Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican who is chairman of the committee, said tariffs imposed on steel and aluminum on national security grounds are disrupting supply chains and hurting businesses. Trump’s threat to impose similar tariffs on autos would do even more damage, he said.</p>
<p>“I’m very concerned about the president’s trade policies and I think we all should be,” said Corker, who isn’t running for re-election and is often critical of Trump. “Many Americans could and will lose their jobs.”</p>
<p>House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican, questioned Trump’s trade policies in an interview on Bloomberg Television. He said the U.S. shouldn’t impose tariffs on auto imports on national security grounds.</p>
<p>""Why are we picking a fight with the whole world?"" Hensarling said</p>
<p>Ryan, speaking Thursday at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C., drew a stark difference between his vision for trade and that of Trump.</p>
<p>“We risk having American products locked out of new markets, jobs moved overseas, and a decline in American influence,” said Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican. “As our generals will tell you, these agreements are just as important for our national security as they are for our economy.”</p>
<p>A bipartisan bill unveiled this week in the House would require congressional review of any tariffs proposed on national security grounds. Ryan, however, said such legislation isn’t going to pass and that it’s “more effective and constructive” to work with the administration.</p>    <div class=""clear""></div>"

    </div>
        <p>(Bloomberg) -- China said it will levy reciprocal tariffs on U.S. soybeans in a significant escalation of trade tensions between the two countries, sending prices of the oilseed in Chicago tumbling.</p>
<p>The Asian nation plans to impose 25 percent duties on a slew of U.S. agricultural commodities such as soybeans, wheat, corn, cotton, sorghum, tobacco and beef, according to the Ministry of Commerce in Beijing. They are among 106 U.S. products targeted ranging from automobiles to chemicals and aircraft.</p>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc3477a8751e"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">Soybeans</a></span> on the Chicago Board of Trade dropped as much as 4.2 percent, while <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc3477a8781f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">wheat</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc3477a87900"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">corn</a></span> futures also slid.</p>
<p>China is the world’s largest soybean importer and biggest buyer of the oilseed from the U.S. with trade worth about $14 billion last year. The Asian nation’s purchases have climbed to a record as expansion in large-scale livestock farming and a shortage of protein-rich feed grains boost soymeal consumption.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, the U.S. president Donald Trump’s administration has proposed imposing 25 percent tariffs on about $50 billion worth of Chinese-made products. That was after Chinese tariffs on 128 American goods including wine and pork took effect on April 2.</p>
<p>“China’s response carries both economic and political weight as agricultural states are major supporting regions for Trump,” said Monica Tu, an analyst at Shanghai JC Intelligence Co. “The tariffs on U.S. imports including soybeans is China’s response that matches the scale of proposed U.S. tariffs.”</p>
<p>U.S. Ambassador Terry Branstad last month warned China against retaliatory measures aimed at imports of soybeans and said any efforts to curb the trade would harm the Asian nation’s regular citizens more than American growers.</p>
<p>China is the world’s biggest pork producer and consumer and its industry relies on soybean meal, a product of soybean crushing, to feed its pigs. Rising costs for hog farmers risks increasing the price of pork, a component of China’s consumer price index.</p>
<p>While the U.S. counts China as its biggest soybean market, the Asian country last year bought more of the oilseed from Brazil. Bloomberg reported in February that China was studying the impact of restricting soybean imports in retaliation for U.S. tariffs on washing machines and solar panels.</p>
<p>“This will obviously benefit Brazilian exporters,” said Warren Patterson, a commodity strategist at Dutch bank <span itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Corporation""><span itemprop=""name""> ING Groep </span></span> (AS:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/ing-groep"" id=""5fc3477a879d6"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""301"">INGA</a></span>) NV. “They will be licking their lips right now.”</p>

    </div>
        <p>Investing.com - U.S. grain futures fell sharply on Monday, as risk aversion dominated commodity markets amid heightened fears of a messy Greece exit from the euro zone.</p>
<p>Greeks overwhelmingly rejected conditions for a bailout package from creditors in a referendum on Sunday, adding to doubts over Greece’s future in the euro zone and deepening a standoff with its lenders.</p>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/germany-30"" id=""5fc3473483c16"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""172"">European stock markets</a></span> sank on Monday and the yields on Italian, Spanish and Portuguese bonds spiked after the ""No"" camp's strong victory on Sunday.</p>
<p>The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/eur-usd"" id=""5fc3473483f11"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""1"">euro</a></span> was down 0.75% to 1.1028, after hitting a session low of 1.0970. The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/us-dollar-index"" id=""5fc3473483ffb"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8827"">U.S. dollar index</a></span>, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.3% to 96.66, boosted by the weaker euro.</p>
<p>In a surprise move, Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis resigned on Monday, despite the referendum results. In a statement, Varoufakis said his decision was prompted in part by “some European participants” expressing a desire for his part in any further negotiations to end.</p>
<p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande were set to meet in Paris on Monday afternoon, while euro zone leaders were expected to hold a conference on Tuesday night to discuss the aftermath of the Greek referendum.</p>
<p>European officials have indicated that they will only continue to finance Greece in return for far-reaching economic reforms.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc34734840e6"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">US wheat</a></span> for September delivery plunged 13.98 cents, or 2.37%, to trade at $5.7562 a bushel during U.S. morning hours.</p>
<p>Later in the day, the U.S. Department of Agriculture will release updated crop progress numbers for the week ended July 5.</p>
<p>Nearly 38% of the U.S. winter-wheat crop was harvested as of June 29, compared to 19% a week earlier. Approximately 42% of the crop was harvested in the same week last year, while the five-year average for this time of year is 46%.</p>
<p>The USDA forecast domestic wheat reserves as of June 1 at 753 million bushels last week, up from 590 million on the same date a year earlier. According to the agency, farmers in the U.S. will plant 56.079 million acres of wheat this year, compared with 56.822 million in 2014.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc34734841c7"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">US corn</a></span> for September delivery dropped 7.73 cents, or 1.81%, to trade at $4.1988 a bushel. Corn hit a seven-month peak of $4.3060 on July 2 after the USDA estimated that U.S. farmers had planted 88.897 million acres of corn this year, down from 90.597 million last year.</p>
<p>A separate USDA report showed that domestic corn inventories totaled 4.447 billion bushels on June 1, compared with 3.852 billion bushels on that date last year.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the Chicago Board of Trade, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34734842c3"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">US soybeans</a></span> for August delivery tumbled 19.2 cents, or 1.85%, to trade at $10.1900. Prices of the oilseed rallied to a seven-month high of $10.5460 on July 1 after the USDA said that U.S. farmers will plant 85.139 million acres of soybeans this year, compared with 83.701 million last year.</p>
<p>According to the USDA, domestic stockpiles at the beginning of June totaled 625 million bushels, up from 405 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>While the soybean and corn stockpile estimates were both higher compared to a year earlier, the results came in below market expectations due to heavy demand for the commodities.</p>
<p>Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, government figures show. Wheat was fourth, behind hay.</p>

<p><strong>It's the last week of August. </strong>Several economic reports will be released in the coming days. They include the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/pce-deflator-1772"" id=""5fc3499b5bdc8"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1772"">US deflator of consumer expenditures</a></span> that the Federal Reserve targets, China's <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/manufacturing-pmi-594"" id=""5fc3499b5bfd9"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""594"">PMI</a></span>, and the eurozone's preliminary August <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cpi-928"" id=""5fc3499b5c07a"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""928"">CPI</a></span>. It is not that the data do not matter, but investors realize the die is cast.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>They are looking further afield.</strong> The next U.S. tax increase on Chinese imports goes into effect on September 1, and Beijing has threatened to retaliate. The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/fed-interest-rate-decision-168"" id=""5fc3499b5c121"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""168"">Federal Reserve</a></span> and the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/ecb-interest-rate-decision-164"" id=""5fc3499b5c1b8"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""164"">ECB</a></span> will ease policy in the coming weeks. The twice-delayed Japanese sales tax hike will be implemented in about five weeks. </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong> A cartoon I saw recently seems to capture the sentiment in the market at the moment. </strong>One person was carrying a sign like the ""end is nigh"" and another person complains about the optimism, that this could last forever. Whether it is the protest in Hong Kong, negative interest rates, or the U.S.-China trade conflict, many think the status quo is unsustainable, and others believe it can persist as in a ""new normal.""</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong> Paradoxically, both may be true. </strong>The market may have gone too far in the short-term, but it does not mean a return to the status quo ante. Some suspect that the collapse of Argentina's 100-year bond that was oversubscribed when it was sold in 2017 ($9.75 bln of bids for the $2.75 bln offering) and the poor reception to Germany's sale of a zero-coupon <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/rates-bonds/germany-30-year-bond-yield"" id=""5fc3499b5b002"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""23696"">30-year</a></span> bond (which based on pricing was tantamount to a yield-to-maturity of -11 bp), is a turning point. It also coincides with a ratchet up in the decibel of arguments that monetary policy is exhausted and fiscal policy is required.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The poor data from northern Europe, and especially the slump in Germany, are fanning hopes that the purse strings will loosen. </strong>The Bundesbank acknowledged that the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/german-gdp-738"" id=""5fc3499b5c554"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""738"">German economy</a></span> may be contracting in the current quarter, which would be the third of the past five quarters. The year-over-year pace has been below 1% for the past three quarters. Germany is moving to end the Solidarity Tax for most, but there still is a reluctance to do anything meaningful in terms of new stimulus, which, as of last week, the Bundesbank thought unnecessary. Yet, even the amount that the German SPD Finance Minister suggested (~50 bln euros) seemed like a rounding error for the roughly 3.4 trillion <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/eur-usd"" id=""5fc3499b5b27d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""1"">euro</a></span> economy.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>In our big-picture narrative (See <a href=""http://www.marctomarket.com/p/political-economy-of-tomorrow.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>), the Great Financial Crisis was the end of strategy (cash register) lead by Reagan and Thatcher to overcome the economic challenges (stagflation) of the 1970s. </strong>We are in an interregnum period. The old has fallen before the new arises. The parallel is when Nixon unilaterally ended the dollar's last ties to <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc3499b5b333"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">gold</a></span> 48-years ago this month and announced wage and price controls. Little did anyone know that the Reagan-Thatcher strategy would take everyone in the exact opposite direction.</p>
<p><strong>In this interregnum period, economists, investors, and armchair quarterbacks bounce between advocating monetary and fiscal policy to address the challenges. </strong>If monetary policy has been over-relied on in recent years, it is that many previously argued fiscal policy was exhausted. How can a debt crisis be addressed by more debt, cried a common refrain?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>We are in between, and in that vacuum, economic nationalism stepped up</strong>. It could be a place holder, and perhaps it may not be clear until after 2020. Although the U.S. does not have a monopoly on economic nationalism, a re-embracement of the multilateralism could go a long way toward arresting this movement. On the other hand, there is no reason that the next strategy <em>must be</em> in the liberal internationalist tradition.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>China had put investors on notice that it would take action if the U.S. escalated the trade conflict, and ahead of the weekend, it did just that</strong>. Like the U.S., it announced a set to begin on September 1 and another to be levied in mid-December. U.S. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc3499b5b3e7"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">crude oil</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc3499b5b497"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soy</a></span> will be taxed by an extra 5% starting next month, for example, while the 25% tariff on U.S. cars that had been previously suspended would be re-instituted. Some models would be hit with an additional 10% tax, in mid-December. All told, some U.S. vehicles will have as much as a 50% tariff.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Investors voted with their wallets before the weekend in the same way they responded to the tweeted end of the second tariff truce to start the month. </strong>The knock-on effect on the U.S. economy is understood to mean slower growth, boosting risk of a recession, and dragging interest rates lower. The growth concerns and disruptive trade impulses weigh on equities more than lower interest rates help. The dollar weakens.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>In some ways, the U.S. trade policy is driving Fed policy expectations. </strong>The Fed sees its job as sustaining the economic expansion by striving toward full employment and 2% PCE deflator (1.4% in June and July is due on August 31). Currently, the economy continues to appear to be growing around what the Fed forecasts suggest is trend (i.e., non-inflationary) growth. The labor market remains robust, and the decline in <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/initial-jobless-claims-294"" id=""5fc3499b5c606"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""294"">weekly jobless claims</a></span> last week is notable because it covered the same week that the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/nonfarm-payrolls-227"" id=""5fc3499b5c6ab"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""227"">nonfarm payroll</a></span> survey was conducted. Consumption looks vigorous and July <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/real-personal-consumption-895"" id=""5fc3499b5c74c"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""895"">consumption expenditures</a></span>, to be reported at the end of next week, are expected to have risen by 0.5% on the month. There are some signs of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/ism-manufacturing-pmi-173"" id=""5fc3499b5c7fb"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""173"">manufacturing</a></span> weakness (the Aug flash PMI slipped to 49.9 from 50.0), and there are admittedly pockets of weakness, like business investment.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The biggest risk to the expansion is the unintended but not unforeseeable consequences of the U.S. trade policy. </strong>Prior to Powell's <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/fed-chair-powell-speaks-1738"" id=""5fc3499b5c8a5"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1738"">speech</a></span> and the presidential tweetstorm, the market had pulled away from its extreme aggressiveness. It has pushed the implied yield of the January 2020 Fed funds futures 20 bp higher as the market moved away from expectations for three more cuts this year. However, following Trump's aggressive tweets, the implied yield fell from 1.58% to 1.465%. The swing in policy expectations reflects a broad understanding of the Fed's reaction function. It would be responding to the materialization of the risks it clearly recognized.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The European Central Bank may want to take a different approach. </strong>It sees its credibility on the line. It must demonstrate it can achieve its single mandate for close to but below 2% <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cpi-68"" id=""5fc3499b5c948"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""68"">CPI</a></span> over the medium-term. The preliminary estimate for August <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cpi-928"" id=""5fc3499b5c9e9"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""928"">CPI</a></span> may see both the headline and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/core-cpi-922"" id=""5fc3499b5cd6e"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""922"">core</a></span> rates converge at 1.0%. The problem so defined lends itself to a solution: jump ahead of market expectations, which operationally may mean shock and awe. However, it is more difficult done than said. The instruments are well known (rates, and possible tiering, asset purchases, loans, forward guidance), and the quantities are seen as limited.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>China has had plenty of opportunities to ease monetary policy, including the re-animation of its prime loan facility. </strong>The fact that it has not does not mean it won't, but it seems to reflect a lack of urgency, to say the same thing a bit different;y, it seems that officials have other priorities. The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-cny"" id=""5fc3499b5b551"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""2111"">yuan</a></span> has weakened against the dollar for the past seven sessions. The downside momentum appeared to have eased as the dollar approached CNY7.10. However, the escalation of the trade conflict saw the dollar rally against the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-cnh"" id=""5fc3499b5b603"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""961728"">offshore yuan</a></span> (~CNH7.14), as the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/us-dollar-index"" id=""5fc3499b5b6b5"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8827"">greenback</a></span> weakened against the major currencies and strengthened against emerging market currencies. The risk is for further yuan weakness in the coming days, though after a certain level, we suspect tariffs will be more symbolic than substantive. For example, a 25% tariff may make an imported good uncompetitive. Raising the tariff to 30% will likely have marginal impact.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The pre-weekend escalation of the conflict triggered a sharp sell-off in U.S. shares and a dramatic drop in interest rates. </strong>This will likely carry over into next week's price action. The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-jpy"" id=""5fc3499b5b762"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""3"">Japanese yen</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-chf"" id=""5fc3499b5b808"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""4"">Swiss franc</a></span> were the strongest currencies. The Swiss National Bank appears to have been intervening in recent weeks, but besides warning that the MOF was watching yen movements closely a couple of weeks ago, Japan has been quiet about the yen's appreciation. However, should the dollar fall through the JPY105 area, their protests may increase as the next main level is JPY100. Emerging markets, which typically do better with stronger prospects for the world economy, will continue to be shunned. The JP Morgan emerging market currency index fell to new lows for the year ahead of the weekend. The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/msci-emerging-markets"" id=""5fc3499b5b8b7"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""101764"">MSCI Emerging Markets Equities</a></span> index has fallen a little more than 6% this month and finished poorly ahead of the weekend.</p>
<p><strong>The week ahead is about the echo from this past week and the siren's song of September. </strong></p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

        <p>Investing.com - Stocks took a beating Thursday as investors worried that a U.S.-China trade war could drag on indefinitely and sap global growth.</p>
<p>The only good news was that the major indexes bounced off their lows in the last hour of trading. The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/us-30"" id=""5fc34787cded4"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""169"">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a></span> fell 1.1%. The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/us-spx-500"" id=""5fc34787ce1b5"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""166"">S&amp;P 500</a></span> slumped 1.2% and the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/nasdaq-composite"" id=""5fc34787ce2a6"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""14958"">Nasdaq Composite</a></span> dropped 1.6%. At their lows, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 had been off as much as 1.7% with the Nasdaq off 2.1%.</p>
<p>Stocks have succumbed to selling pressure in May after Washington and Beijing engaged in tit-for-tat tariffs and other retaliatory measures, with the S&amp;P 500 on track to post its worst monthly decline since the December selloff.</p>
<p>Beijing said on Thursday Washington needs to correct its ""wrong actions"" for trade talks to continue after the United States blacklisted Huawei Technology last week.</p>
<p>In further evidence of the trade war hitting the U.S. economy, data from IHS Markit showed <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/manufacturing-pmi-829"" id=""5fc34787d05d2"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""829"">manufacturing growth</a></span> measured its weakest pace of activity in nearly a decade and new orders fell for the first time since August 2009.</p>
<p>The Trump Administration outlined a $16-billion plan to help farmers offset the impact of the trade war on Thursday. Nonetheless, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc34787ce384"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">wheat prices</a></span>, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc34787ce47c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">corn prices</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34787ce56a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybean prices</a></span> all fell.</p>
<p>The Dow was off as many as 448 points before bargain hunters started to buy across the market, cutting the day's losses to 286 points. The Dow finished the day looking at its fifth-straight weekly loss. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq were looking at their third weekly losses in a row. The Dow is off 4.1% for May while the S&amp;P is down 4.2% and the Nasdaq 5.77%. The Dow is is 5.4% below its 52-week high, reached in October. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are 4.6% and 6.7% below their 52-week highs, reached in April.</p>
<p>The selling was broad, with energy, industrial and technology shares taking the brunt of the selling pressure.

Fast forward almost half a century later, and mainstream economists are still having a problem deciphering the linkages between prices and economic activity, such as inflation and employment. Theory needs to accommodate the new facts.</p>
<p><strong>Theory is being challenged in another profound way now. </strong>Germany, the world's fourth-largest economy appears to be contracting and experiencing disinflation pressures despite its entire yield curve being below zero. Negative rates have not spurred inflation. It has not bolstered investment. The lower price of money (interest rates) has not spurred demand for it. This is true throughout Europe. Negative rates do not preclude recessions. Nor are they necessarily inflationary as theory might suggest. U.S. and UK inflation is running higher than in the eurozone and Japan, even though the latter have negative interest rates.</p>
<p><strong>Germany, unlike Japan, abhors debt and has, until recentl</strong>y<strong>, not been keen to jettison the ""black zero""</strong> of austerity. Given the debt servicing costs,  many officials still seem to think that they can have their cake and eat it too. Spending can be boosted, and taxes cut without taking on greater debt costs.

<p><strong>At last month's initial tranche of targeted long-term refinancing operations, the ECB practically could not give money away. </strong>There may have been some technical considerations deterring interest, and stronger demand is expected at the next tranche in December. Still, the point remains unmarred that the experiment with negative nominal rates has not generated the kind of economic outcomes that were expected.</p>
<p><strong>While nominal rates are not negative in the U.S., depending on how it is calculated, real interest rates are near or below zero. </strong>The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/rates-bonds/u.s.-10-year-bond-yield"" id=""5fc34a6898a74"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""23705"">10-year</a></span> yield is near 1.53%, and the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/rates-bonds/u.s.-2-year-bond-yield"" id=""5fc34a6898e61"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""23701"">2-year</a></span> yield is about 1.4%. The U.S. reports September CPI figures on October 10. The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cpi-69"" id=""5fc34a689b400"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""69"">headline rate</a></span> is expected to rise to almost 2%, and the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/core-cpi-56"" id=""5fc34a689b4f8"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""56"">core rate</a></span> stable around 2.4%. There are expectations for a of couple market-based measures of inflation. The 10 through 30-year breakevens (the difference between the conventional and inflation-linked yields) are 1.50%-1.60%, and the five-year five-year forward (the expected rate of inflation for five years beginning five years from now) is at 1.90%.</p>
<p><strong>Low and negative interest rates are spurring neither growth nor inflation. </strong>With little real or nominal growth, distributional issues come back to the fore. There are national variations on this theme, but it seems to be a common source of the current political populism. Low real and nominal rates are a function of large economic forces, including weaker population growth, slower productivity growth, past technological advances, and a competitive environment for goods production. </p>
<p><strong>Social organization is important. </strong>Capital launched an offensive in the face of falling profits and stagflation in the 1970s. The governments of the UK and the U.S. purposely weakened unions, the one institution whose raison d'etre was to boost labor's share of the social product. Capital increased its dominance and took an increasingly bigger share. It was too successful. It has so much money, it does not know what to do, so it gives it back to shareholders in the form of buybacks and/or dividends. One CEO of a large internet company claimed to have so much money that he would need to go into space to spend it. Really?  And seriously boosting the compensation of the median employee and/or accepting smaller margins is ideologically unthinkable? </p>
<p><strong>There is a great disparity among companies, but business as a whole in the U.S. is sitting with large savings. </strong>This does not mean corporations do not borrow money. Of course, they do, but they do this on the whole, as part of ""tax minimization"" strategies and other financial considerations. Corporate America is a net creditor. They are a source of capital, not net borrowers. Lenin had it wrong when he said that  ""the capitalists will sell us the rope with which we hang them.""  They apparently are hanging themselves. The biggest threat to capitalism and the ability of the social classes to reproduce those relations is the success of capitalists themselves. They have garnered such a surplus that it drives below zero the return on coupon-clipping (passive ""risk-free"" investment). What Keynes called the ""euthanasia of the rentier class,""  which we seem to be experiencing now, was not at the hands of communists but results of the dynamic of capitalism itself.</p>

<p><strong>The Federal Reserve's <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/fomc-meeting-minutes-108"" id=""5fc34a689b85e"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""108"">minutes</a></span> from the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/analysis/divided-fed-cuts-rates-but-disappoints-stumbles-on-market-mechanics-200465976"" id=""5fc34a689a161"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""pal"" data-articleid=""200465976"">September meeting</a></span> that saw three regional presidents dissent from the decision to cut rates 25 bp will be released. </strong>Two did not think a cut was warranted, and one thought a quarter-point move was too small. The record from the ECB's recent meeting that saw several officials speak out against the decision and many link the resignation of Germany's Lautenschlaeger to the disagreement, though no reason has been given, will be reported. The objections to the ECB's actions spurred several former officials from Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, and France to write a <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2019-10-04/memorandum-on-ecb-monetary-policy-by-issing-stark-schlesinger"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">""memorandum""</a> outlining their criticism.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The Federal Reserve may not be as divided as the three dissents, and the dot plot suggests. </strong>First, there have not been dissents from any of the Governors, and Vice-Chairman Clarida's emphasis on reaching the 2% inflation target implies that the Board favors a cut. That is five votes, but the NY Fed President Williams has a permanent vote at the FOMC and will vote with the Governors. Bullard, who is the leading dove, might be persuaded to support a 25 bp cut and close ranks. That leaves the standpat Rosengren and George, who objected to both the July and September cuts.</p>
<p><strong>The weakness in the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/manufacturing-pmi-829"" id=""5fc34a689b921"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""829"">PMI</a></span>/<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/ism-manufacturing-pmi-173"" id=""5fc34a689b9f9"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""173"">ISM</a></span> reports and the fall in U.S. equities spurred speculation of not one but possibly two Fed <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/central-banks/fed-rate-monitor"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""frl"">rate cuts</a></span> this year; one at the end of this month and one at the last meeting in mid-December. </strong>The 2-year note yield fell more than 20 bp last week. The yield of the January 2020 Fed funds futures contract fell by 12 bp last week to 1.455%. The current average effective rate is around 1.83%-1.85%. The U.S. employment data, however, does not show an economy falling off the cliff as some of the survey data seemed to imply.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/nonfarm-payrolls-227"" id=""5fc34a689baae"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""227"">Job growth</a></span> slowed, but it was still sufficient to see the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/unemployment-rate-300"" id=""5fc34a689bb5f"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""300"">unemployment rate</a></span> fall to 3.5%, its lowest level since the end of 1969, and that was with a steady <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/participation-rate-1581"" id=""5fc34a689bc19"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1581"">participation rate</a></span> (63.2%). </strong>The underemployment rate also fell to a new cyclical low (6.9% vs. 7.2%). Back-month revisions are understood by some economists as an indication of the underlying trend, and the 45k upward revisions help offset the somewhat lower than expected nonfarm payroll gain in September.</p>
<p><strong>The main disappointment, however, was with the flat <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/average-hourly-earnings-8"" id=""5fc34a689bccf"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""8"">average hourly earnings</a></span>, which saw the year-over-year increase slip to 2.9% from 3.2%. </strong>It is the lowest since last July. The UAW strike at General Motors (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/gen-motors"" id=""5fc34a6898f9d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""239"">GM</a></span>) might have impacted earnings even if the jobs survey was conducted before the strike began in a statistical quirk. Next month's nonfarm payroll report will pick up the strike at GM, provided if it lasts through the end of next week, which at this juncture looks likely.</p>
<p><strong>Based on this week's developments, we see no reason to alter our base case that the Fed stands pat at the FOMC meeting at the end of this month. </strong>We expect the Fed to focus on the plumbing and favor a permanent repo facility as the most likely way to boost repo liquidity rather than increasing reserves (organically or through QE) and hoping that the banks will repo the excess reserves. The Federal Reserve is likely to reserve QE for the conduct of monetary policy. It needs to help investors keep separate the plumbing issues (maturity transformations) from the decision about the price and quantity of money. After standing pat in October, we look for a cut at the December 11 meeting for largely the same reasons as the first two cuts in H2 19: below target inflation presents a low-cost opportunity to help extend the expansion.</p>
<p><strong>The ECB is not nearly as fragmented as it sounds either, but the fissure there may be more profound. </strong>Many of the differences between the Fed and ECB seem superficial, but one important distinction is in the structure. When fully staffed, the Board of Governors at the Fed have a majority of votes at the FOMC. There are two vacant seats presently. There are more regional presidents, but four rotate and the NY Fed president, as we noted before has a permanent vote. The Federal Reserve was designed to give the Governors control. The ECB has a relatively small board, and a larger number of the <em>regional presidents </em>vote even though a rotating system has been introduced.</p>
<p><strong>Of the seven former officials that signed or endorsed the memo cited above, only two came from the ECB's executive board, the other five were from national central banks</strong>. The two former Board members and one former president of a central bank, which means three of the seven, came from Germany. Lautsenshlaeger, who recently resigned, was not one of the endorsers.</p>
<p><strong>The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/analysis/ecb-resignation-exposes-eurozones-growing-northsouth-rift-200469756"" id=""5fc34a689ae4c"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""pal"" data-articleid=""200469756"">main divide</a></span> is between creditors and debtors. </strong>Germany, the Netherlands, Austria objected to asset purchases from the get-go. Estonia also objected though none of its officials were included in the memo. France's official objection last month seemed to stem from the timing, unlike the others who opposed on principle. Like the distribution problem discussed above, the tension between creditor and debtor interests can be ameliorated by stronger growth, and some would argue, more federalism (e.g., Draghi endorsing a fiscal union). The new ECB president may seek procedural solutions to the division, such as developing the ECB record to allow individual arguments to be expressed and identified, which Draghi resisted. However, the underlying challenge is that the creditors are a minority in Europe.</p>
<p><strong>On substantive grounds, the survey and real sector data continue to weaken while the lending data and money supply growth are firm. </strong>Germany's August <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/german-factory-orders-130"" id=""5fc34a689c08a"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""130"">factory orders</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/german-industrial-production-135"" id=""5fc34a689c425"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""135"">industrial production</a></span> reports are the highlights in the week ahead. Factory orders plunged 2.7%  in July, which offset in full the rise in June. Orders are expected to have fallen around 0.4% in August. The average monthly decline through July has been 1.0% compared with a 0.9% average decline in the same 2018 period. The year-over-year contraction is expected to deepen from the -5.6% in July to closer -6.7% in August. The worst so far was recorded in May with an 8.5% year-over-year decline.</p>
<p><strong>Industrial output is weakening. It has fallen in three of the four months through July. </strong>The average monthly decline this year has been 0.5% compared with a 0.2% decline in the first seven months of 2018. The year-over-year contraction reached a 10-year extreme of -4.7% in June. It stood at -4.2% in July and is expected to have remained there in August. There seems little doubt that the German economy more broadly is contracting and that deflationary winds are strengthening, and that was before the escalation of trade tensions with the U.S..</p>
<p><strong>The U.S. tariffs in response to the WTO ruling will be implemented in a couple of weeks. President Trump must make a decision about tariffs on autos by the middle of next month. </strong>These risks, coupled with Brexit, remain potent. UK Prime Minister Johnson continues to publicly reject Parliament's instructions to seek a delay if an agreement is not struck soon. In court, the government has indicated it intends to adhere to its legal orders. A three-month delay seems the most likely scenario, during which time the UK will hold a national election. Survey results warn of what the British like to call a hung parliament, which in most other countries is understood as a coalition government.</p>
<p><strong>China returns from its national holiday that began on October 1.

The dollar also eased against many of the major currencies, including the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/eur-usd"" id=""5fc34a689934e"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""1"">euro</a></span>, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-jpy"" id=""5fc34a6899436"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""3"">yen</a></span>, and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/gbp-usd"" id=""5fc34a689955a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""2"">sterling</a></span>.

The data won't change the general impression that the world's second-largest economy continues to slow. Most of this seems to reflect China's own internal dynamics, but part of it is likely traceable to the disruption of U.S. tariffs, the adjustments being made, and the uncertainty of the situation. China's trade delegation comes to the U.S. next week to hold face-to-face talks with the administration. One metric for the negotiations is whether the U.S. refrains from implementing the duties that were already delayed from Oct.1 to Oct. 15.</p>

These actions are driven by China's needs. The fact that they may placate the mercurial American president is an added benefit. The market has responded to heightened trade tensions as a deflationary force and weighs on equities and yields, and often the dollar appears to trade heavier. President Trump's public request that China investigate the Bidens is likely to reinforce Beijing's cautiousness in dealing with Washington and, like when Trump recently claimed Chinese officials called and wanted to resume trade talks, it seems provocative at this level of politics. Imagine what we would think about a foreign leader who did that to us. The U.S. also revealed that a trade agreement, if even struck, would not prevent it from confronting China elsewhere, like on portfolio flows, arming Taiwan, and the South China Sea. We suspect that the Trump Administration wants a trade deal now more than China.</p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

<p></p>
<p><strong>COPPER</strong> prices were given a boost yesterday after China released better-than-expected industrial production data for June. This data proved to be more influential than the weaker growth numbers for the second quarter, which had been fully expected and priced in. Prices jumped to the highest in two weeks amid hopes for a pickup in demand, closing above the 55-day moving average for the first time since April 30.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Speculative positioning was the most bearish since June 2016, the latest data to July 9 from <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-copper-speculative-net-positions-1620"" id=""5fc3486330060"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1620"">CFTC</a></span> showed, and the rebound could force some liquidation of those shorts in next week’s data.</p>

<p></p>
<h3><strong>Agriculturals</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p><strong>SOYBEANS</strong> posted the biggest weekly gain in four weeks last week as news broke that the US-China trade negotiations were restarting. Prices hit the high for the month before retreating and are now facing the second down-day in a row.</p>
<p></p>
<p>China reported that imports of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc348632fca3"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">US soybeans</a></span> were lower than expected in June, despite US claims that that China had agreed to buy more agricultural products. June imports were down 11.5% year-on-year and the lowest since 2014 as the trade war and swine fever had an impact. A recent US Department of Agriculture (USDA) report estimated that Brazil’s portion of China soy imports could be as high as 75% for this season, up from just 30% in the 2016/17 season.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Speculative investors remain bearish on the commodity, however, as they increased their net short positions for the first time in eight weeks, according to the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-soybeans-speculative-net-positions-1811"" id=""5fc34863300f7"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1811"">CFTC</a></span> data. Investors have been carrying net short positions since February, with prices since than suffering a 12.8% drop into May followed by a strong rebound to be just 1.56% below February levels at the moment.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>CORN</strong> prices rose to a one-month high yesterday before reversing to post the biggest one-day loss this month. The commodity had found some weather-related buying interest amid concerns that hot, dry weather across the US corn-belt could damage crops. Speculative accounts remain bullish, with the latest data showing net long positions hovering near 13-month highs.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>SUGAR</strong> looks set to decline for a third straight week this week and has traded below the 55-week moving average for the first time since early-June. Oversupply remains a concern for corn traders, with the latest World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report from the USDA forecasting that sugar stocks at the end of the 2018/19 season would be 1.76 million tons, a 15% upward revision from its June forecast. Its forecast for the end of the 2019/20 season was raised 9% to 1.66 million tons, but at least it is still lower than the 2018/19 estimate.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Speculative accounts were net buyers for a sixth week to July 9, according to the latest data snapshot from <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-corn-speculative-net-positions-1813"" id=""5fc348633018b"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1813"">CFTC</a></span>. Net longs are now the highest since the week of April 23.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>WHEAT</strong> prices have been on a downward trajectory for the past three weeks and are falling toward the 55-week moving average at 4.9324. Wheat has declined further this week and looks poised for the biggest weekly loss since April. Speculative investors scaled back their net long positions for the first time in 10 weeks in the week to July 9, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-wheat-speculative-net-positions-1812"" id=""5fc348633021a"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1812"">CFTC</a></span> data showed.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- It’s time for some 2020 foresight in raw materials. After commodities posted a 10% advance last year, how will crude to coffee fare in the months to come? The first What to Watch of the new year presents an overview of what to expect and it’s a mixed, complex picture that emerges. The list covers oil, gold, copper, iron ore, pork and more.</p>
<p>The year’s first full week of trading will be dominated by the Mideast crisis after the American assassination of one of the Iran’s most powerful generals. Crude and gold surged on Monday after President Donald Trump said he was prepared to strike Iran “in a disproportionate manner” if it hits any U.S. target. RBC Capital Markets has warned of “a retaliatory spiral.”</p>
<p>Challenging Times</p>
<p></p><p>The complex number-crunching and informed guesswork used to generate year-to-come predictions in the global <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/brent-oil"" id=""5fc350625db1e"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8833"">oil</a></span> market have been thrown into disarray by the sharp escalation of tensions between Washington and Tehran. Prior to the U.S. killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, investors were focused on whether continued efforts by OPEC and its allies to curb production would be sufficient to counter a global glut supported by rising U.S. shale supply and new output from outside the cartel, including fields in Guyana.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>With that in mind, analysts had been forecasting <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc350625de8a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">WTI</a></span> at just below $59 a barrel; but on Monday the benchmark rallied above $70 as the two sides traded ever harsher rhetoric. Further gains will depend on developments this week, including potential risks to crude shipped via the Strait of Hormuz. Tensions between the U.S and Iran disrupted oil markets last year but the episodes were short-lived; the current standoff is of far greater magnitude.</p><p></p>
<p>Brighter Prospects</p>
<p></p><p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/copper"" id=""5fc350625df8c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8831"">Copper</a></span> struggled to sustain a rally in 2019 as the trade war spurred destocking of inventories by manufacturers. Now, the outlook is turning brighter with the preliminary truce between Washington and Beijing easing demand concerns for the metal used in everything from automobiles to electronics. Potential output cuts by Chinese smelters also point to tighter supply at a time when stockpiles tracked by the London Metal Exchange are at the lowest in nine months.</p><p></p>

Citigroup forecasts China’s demand will expand 2.6% this year, underpinned by gains in grid investment. While prices fell on Friday as the Mideast tensions hurt appetite for risk, they remain above $6,000 a ton.</p>
<p>Golden Promise</p>
<p></p><p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc350625e4ac"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">Gold</a></span> just delivered a stellar year for bulls as the Federal Reserve cut rates, trade tensions hurt growth, central banks beefed up reserves and ETF holdings swelled. The haven’s upward march may not be quite done: Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Citigroup Inc and UBS Group AG have all said they’re looking for $1,600 an ounce, and RBC Capital Markets is positive too. And those calls were made before the Iranian crisis sent bullion tearing higher.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>On top of the Mideast tensions, additional underlying positivity toward bullion comes as the Fed signals that rates will almost certainly be on hold right throughout this year, at least until central bank officials have seen a “material reassessment” in their outlook. Among other precious metals, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/palladium"" id=""5fc350625e710"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8883"">palladium</a></span> also demands attention as a persistent global deficit looks set to fuel gains far beyond $2,000 an ounce.</p><p></p>
<p>A Strong Brew</p>
<p></p><p>Bulls in arabica <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/arabica-coffee-4-5"" id=""5fc350625e807"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""964526"">coffee</a></span>, coming off its best year in five, will be watching developments in Brazil, the top producer and exporter. After 2019’s harvest was marred by irregular weather and poor quality, the country’s green bean stockpiles are set to drop to the lowest in more than five decades, and any signs of more production issues may exacerbate the tight supply scenario.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>In addition to a forecast world deficit in 2019-2020 technical indicators are strong, with the beans favored by <span itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Corporation""><span itemprop=""name""> <span itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Corporation""><span itemprop=""name""> Starbucks Corp </span></span> </span></span>.

While traders will be looking for signs of increased output, many growers are still under financial distress, and that may limit resumption of farm investments. Meantime, a further depreciation in the Brazilian <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-brl"" id=""5fc350625ea2b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""2103"">real</a></span> could raise prospects for increased supplies in the years to come.</p><p></p>
<p>Headed South</p>
<p></p><p>After a tumultuous year, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/iron-ore-62-cfr-futures"" id=""5fc350625eb1e"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""961729"">iron ore</a></span> is expected to slide in 2020. The steelmaking material capped the biggest annual gain in three years in 2019 on a shortage triggered by a dam disaster at Brazil’s Vale SA (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/vale-s.a.--americ"" id=""5fc350625ec0f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""13059"">VALE</a></span>). Prices, which hit as much as $120 a ton in July, ended the year near $90, while shares of miners such as BHP Group (LON:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/bhp-billiton"" id=""5fc350625ed1c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""6617"">BHPB</a></span>) rose. <span itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Corporation""><span itemprop=""name""> <span itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Corporation""><span itemprop=""name""> Fortescue Metals </span></span> </span></span> Group Ltd's (ASX:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/fortescue-metals"" id=""5fc35062602f4"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""628"">FMG</a></span>) stock more than doubled.</p><p></p>
<p>As seaborne supply expands this year from Brazil and Australia the deficit is seen closing, and there’s a chorus of forecasts for prices to weaken. Top producer Australia sees iron ore averaging $63 a ton, and the material is Morgan Stanley’s least-favored commodity. In China, steel demand is expected to fall as economic growth slows, hurting iron ore consumption.</p>
<p>Running a Fever</p>
<p>Unprecedented outbreaks of African swine fever upended the pork trade in 2019, and whether the spread continues will be a key driver for meat markets going forward. The fallout lifted global meat prices to a five-year high and sent pork exports from Europe and elsewhere surging. China’s hog population -- the world’s largest -- has collapsed, and traders will be eyeing whether a recovery in herds comes as quickly as some government officials have pledged.</p>
<p>Outside of Asia, the market will focus on whether the disease strikes any major pork shippers, risking further trade disruption. The virus has moved nearer to Poland’s border with Germany, a key European producer, and officials are stockpiling fences and training boar-sniffing dogs in a bid to ward off the threat. It also remains to be seen by how much China will boost purchases of U.S. pork after the nations reached an initial trade agreement.</p>
<p>All Change!</p>
<p>Climate change and how governments, companies and funds respond will shape investment decisions in 2020 as never before. This year, the amount of new wind and solar power generation capacity will cross the 200-gigawatt threshold, boosting the total to about 1,450 gigawatts, BloombergNEF says. To put that in perspective, that’s just shy of 20% of global installed capacity.</p>
<p>That shift will see renewables close the gap with natural gas as the biggest potential source of electricity behind coal, though their intermittent nature will leave them lagging behind in terms of actual output. The variability will also increase challenges for grids and traditional utilities to keep all the lights on, while pressuring wholesale power prices on gusty or bright days.</p>
<p>Palm Reading</p>
<p></p><p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/palm-oil"" id=""5fc350626041d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""992745"">Palm oil</a></span> was one of the big winners among commodities in the second half of 2019, and there are signals prices will remain well-supported. The most-used vegetable oil ended the year with a 44% gain, the best showing in a decade, lifted by concerns dry weather and haze will curb supplies from top growers Indonesia and Malaysia, as well as prospects for strong biofuel demand.</p><p></p>
<p>The latest Bloomberg survey showed prices may average 2,400 ringgit ($587) a ton this quarter, compared with 2,248 ringgit over all of 2019. Participants flagged Indonesia as a key factor, with Southeast Asia’s top economy boosting palm’s share in its biofuel blend to 30% from 20%. Still, questions remain on export markets, especially the European Union’s limit on palm oil use.</p>
<p>Bulls &amp; Bears</p>

Soon the two major economies of the world will sign a partial trade deal suggested earlier this month, an eruptive move in Soybeans Futures will confirm the intensity of the currently prevailing bullish sentiments. No doubt that the China still has to take a final decision about the size of  his purchase of U.S. agricultural products, but the growing bullish sentiments in Soybeans Futures look evident enough of an upcoming rally.</p><p></p><div class=""outerEleWrapper"">

The Export Sales were pretty healthy with export demand mainly from China.

Their Pekin plant is on track to achieve annual capacity of about 135 million gallons by the end of the year, up from 80 million gallons in March.</p>
<p>Pacific Ethanol stocks took a hit in yesterday’s action and they were not alone as fears grip investors when our so-called local governments have no answer except, don’t even get out of bed today stay locked down. There are plenty of cases where that may be true in which I agree, but someone must work to keep this republic and many other countries functioning. Pacific Ethanol is smart moving ahead to diversify in case there is a rise for more product other than putting ethanol in the gas tank.

<li>Energy and meats present unique challenges in 2020</li>
</ul><p>The United States is the global leader in the production and export of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34c8c05d7b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc34c8c06082"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">corn</a></span> to the world. The U.S.'s agricultural sector is also a significant producer of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc34c8c06162"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">wheat</a></span>, the primary ingredient in bread.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Agricultural commodities are the staples that feed populations around the globe. At the end of April 2020, there were approximately 7.65 billion mouths to feed in the world, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Each year, the number of people on our planet grows by around eighty million. Therefore, the demand side of the equation for food is always expanding.</p>
<p>The crop year in the northern hemisphere begins with planting in the spring. During the summer months crops grow, leading to the fall harvest. When it comes to the prices of corn, soybeans, and wheat futures, it's weather conditions across the critical growing areas in the United States and other producing nations around the world that determine the size of annual crops.</p>
<p>As we are now in the heart of the spring season, uncertainty about the weather over the coming months typically causes increased price volatility in the grain futures markets at this time of the year. But 2020 is hardly an ordinary year in markets across all asset classes because of the global pandemic, and agricultural products are no exception.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Each year is a new adventure</strong></h2><p>The agricultural products that feed the world do not have the same shelf life as other commodities like <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc34c8c0623e"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">crude oil</a></span>, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/copper"" id=""5fc34c8c06325"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8831"">copper</a></span>, and many others. While grains and other agricultural products can sit in silos and terminals when production is higher than consumption, they deteriorate over time. Therefore, each crop year is a new adventure as the growing population requires more fresh food products each year. Bumper crops have become an addiction for a hungry world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last time grain shortages developed was in 2012 when drought conditions sent the prices of corn and soybeans to all-time highs and wheat to its highest price since 2008 when it reached a record level. Mother Nature determines the weather each year, which is the leading factor when it comes to the path of least resistance of prices.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Corn, beans, and wheat prices fall</strong></h3><p>The global deflationary spiral has sent the prices of grains to low levels as the planting season in the U.S. will lead to the all-important growing season in May and the summer months. The potential for drought conditions can cause price spikes in the grains during the growing season as futures prices become as fickle as the weather.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The monthly chart of nearby corn futures on the CBOT shows that at the $3.11 level at the end of last week, the price was near the lowest level in a decade. The last time that corn traded below $3 per bushel was in 2009. Corn traded to a record high of $8.4375 in 2012.</p>

<p>The monthly chart of CBOT soybean futures illustrates that the price of the oilseed at $8.4625 is a lot closer to the low over the past ten years than the high. The beans reached a peak of $17.9475 in 2012 during the last significant drought in the U.S.&nbsp;</p>

Bread is a staple for people around the world, and feeding people is an essential requirement for governments. Throughout history, many examples of civil uprisings were the result of wheat shortages or rising prices. The most recent example was the Arab Spring in 2010, which started as bread riots in Tunisia and Egypt after wheat shortages from the 2008 crop.&nbsp;</div><p>As we head into the 2020 crop year, prices are at low levels, and the markets are assuming that there will be another bumper crop. If Mother Nature does not cooperate, watch out. Should that happen, prices for all of the leading grains could suddenly soar.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Energy and meats present unique challenges in 2020</strong></h2><p>The energy market <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/analysis/commodity-prices-can-fall-below-zero-why-that-happens-how-to-hedge-200522714"" id=""5fc34c8c076b4"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""pal"" data-articleid=""200522714"">collapsed in April</a></span> with crude oil trading to its lowest level in history as the nearby NYMEX futures contract fell into negative territory before expiring.

Corn is the primary ingredient in U.S. ethanol.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img title=""Gasoline Futures Monthly 2008-2020"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic5a01d7ae672a70556071c779736f6c9c.png"" alt=""Gasoline Futures Monthly 2008-2020""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Gasoline Futures Monthly 2008-2020</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p>The monthly chart shows that at the end of April, the price of gasoline was at 75 cents per gallon compared to over $2.00 at the same time in 2019. Since approximately 30% of the annual U.S. corn crop goes into ethanol production, the weakness in gasoline and oil prices was weighing on the price of the coarse grain as it heads into the season of uncertainty.&nbsp;</p><div>&nbsp;</div><div>When it comes to soybeans, processors crush the oilseed into two products, soybean meal, and oil. The meal is the primary ingredient in animal feeds. Cattle and hogs consume soybean meal that fattens the animals before they head to processing plants.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img title=""Lean Hog Futures Monthly 2008-2020"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic5cb692950ca75c5c9f0a3726206b7107.png"" alt=""Lean Hog Futures Monthly 2008-2020""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Lean Hog Futures Monthly 2008-2020</span></div></div></div></div><p>The monthly chart of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/lean-hogs"" id=""5fc34c8c065b6"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8913"">lean hog futures</a></span> shows that the price of pork fell to its lowest level since 2002 in April.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Live cattle fell to the lowest price since 2009. The low prices for meats are leading ranchers to euthanize animals rather than feed them, as processing plants have slowed production because of outbreaks of coronavirus.</p>
<p>In April 2019, the prices of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/live-cattle"" id=""5fc34c8c06686"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8914"">live cattle</a></span> and lean hogs were at $1.2375 and 84.285 cents per pound, respectively. This April, cattle were at the 90 cents level with hogs below 60 cents per pound.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Low energy and meat prices create unique problems for grain prices during the current deflationary spiral. Meanwhile, over 7.6 billion people in the world depend on agricultural products for nutrition. Since the weather will determine supplies, we are now at the time of the year, where uncertainty peaks as the growing season begins.</p>
<p>Adding to that uncertainty is the potential for <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/news/stock-market-news/european-stock-futures-drop-as-us-china-spar-over-virus-origin-2159320"" id=""5fc34c8c0843a"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""oal"" data-articleid=""2159320"">renewed friction</a></span> between the U.S. and China on the trade front. While the two countries signed a phase one trade deal in mid-January, COVID-19 could change the dynamic. The U.S. and other nations blame Chinese leadership for a lack of information that could have controlled the spread of the virus and prevented the pandemic.</p>
<p>Since China has consumed one-quarter of the U.S. annual soybean crop in the past and Chinese pork supplies were ravaged by African swine fever last year, a return of tensions on the trade front could cause more volatility in agricultural commodity prices, especially soybeans and hogs.</p>
<p>With prices at or near the lowest levels in years, the downside potential for prices could be limited and the upside potentially explosive. If drought conditions limit the 2020 crop, we could look back at the end of April as a time when grains were at bargain-basement prices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Investing.com - U.S. soybean futures rose for the second consecutive session on Thursday to move further away from a more than one-week low hit in the previous session as cool and wet weather conditions renewed concerns over crop prospects in the U.S. Midwest.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34753c409e"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">US soybeans</a></span> for August delivery jumped 14.35 cents, or 1.44%, to trade at $10.1175 a bushel during U.S. morning hours.</p>
<p>Excessive rain across the U.S. Midwest is forecast to damage crop conditions and dampen the quality of the harvest.</p>
<p>A day earlier, prices of the oilseed fell to $9.8720, the weakest level since June 30, before recovering to close at $9.9660, up 4.6 cents, or 0.48%.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, nearly 63% of the soybean crop was in good to excellent condition as of July 5, above market expectations.</p>
<p>Soybean emergence was 93% complete, improving from 89% a week earlier, while 21% of the crop bloomed, up from 8% in the preceding week.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc34753c4398"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">US wheat</a></span> for September delivery inched up 2.98 cents, or 0.52%, to trade at $5.8038 a bushel early on Thursday. Wheat dropped 7.6 cents, or 1.32%, on Wednesday to end at $5.7740.</p>
<p>Wheat regained strength after updated weather forecasting models pointed to rainfall in key U.S. wheat-growing states in the coming days.</p>
<p>Prices of the grain had been under pressure this week as drier weather across the U.S. grain belt was expected to boost harvest prospects.</p>
<p>Nearly 55% of the U.S. winter-wheat crop was harvested as of July 5, according to the USDA, up from 38% a week earlier. Approximately 55% of the crop was harvested in the same week last year, while the five-year average for this time of year is 59%.</p>
<p>About 40% of the U.S. winter-wheat crop was rated good to excellent as of last week, down from 41% in the preceding week. The agency also said that nearly 70% of the spring-wheat crop was in good to excellent condition, compared to 72% a week earlier.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the Chicago Board of Trade, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc34753c44a5"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">US corn</a></span> for September delivery tacked on 2.77 cents, or 0.65%, to trade at $4.2738 a bushel in early trade on Thursday. On Wednesday, corn rose 1.2 cents, or 0.3%, to settle at $4.2440.</p>
<p>Approximately 69% of the U.S. corn crop was in good to excellent condition as of July 5, up from 68% in the preceding week and above market forecasts.</p>
<p>Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, government figures show. Wheat was fourth, behind hay.</p>

Corn silking progress in Iowa and Indiana are above the five-year average at 9% and 10% respectively. Total silking was estimated at 50% total US, with the five year average of 54%. That number comes in quite different from last weeks estimates, while the dough making stage is at 9% compared to 7% on average. Today’s weather is expected to have scattered strong to severe thunderstorms capable of large hail and damaging winds expected over portions of the Plains, Midwest, Mississippi Valley and the Ohio Valley. If there is no severe damage accompanied with the storms we should see prices pressured further. December corn is currently trading at 332 ½ which is 3 ¼ cents lower. The trading range has been 335 ¼ to 332.</p>

During the same period of 2019 total RIN generation reached 9.64 billion. Another big news story is some hand sanitizers are dangerous, as they contain methanol, as opposed to ethanol, which contaminates the sanitizer. It causes breathing problems, which is a symptom of coronavirus. It can also cause dryness of skin, headaches, nausea, vomiting, seizures and in some cases death.</p>
<p>Methanol is a wood-based alcohol that is used for anti-freeze and rocket fuel. The FDA warns it does not approve hand sanitizers and any product sanitizer that claims to have the agency's approval is best avoided. If the product contains ethanol, which is derived from grains and sugar, it is safe to use, unlike the deadly concoctions that methanol is derived from.

Haley Zaremba with OILPRICE.com reports that the Dakota Access Pipeline, currently mired in a legal battle with no definite end in sight, with widespread protests and sociopolitical conflict from its inception, was ordered by a district court to shut down operations and dry out by August 5. Now the oil industry is grappling how to ship Bakken crude to market.

Expectations that OPEC and its allies might announce more production cuts at the meeting later this week also helped to lift prices. Ahead of the meeting, Russia’s Putin said he was comfortable with current production levels, but would support any OPEC decision.Speculative investors increased net long positions for a second consecutive week in the week to February 25, according to the latest CFTC data, and they are now at the highest in four weeks.West Texas Intermediate (WTI) posted the biggest weekly decline since at least 2003 last week but has climbed to a five-day high this morning, and is approaching the 50% retracement level of the February 20 to March 10 drop at $48.95.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/natural-gas"" id=""5fc34c71059b9"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8862"">Natural Gas</a></span></strong> prices also brought a seven-day losing streak to an end yesterday and look to be building a second day of gains today. Last week saw the biggest decline since late-November, which saw prices pressured to the lowest in four years.Speculative investors were shaken by the drop last week and turned net sellers for the first time in four weeks, according to CFTC data to February 25.</p>
<h3><strong>Precious metals</strong></h3><p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc34c7105a61"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">Gold</a></span></strong> had a rollercoaster journey last week. At one point, prices touched the highest in more than seven years but then reversed in the latter part of the week to close lower for the first time in three weeks. This week has started off better, with gold reversing ahead of the 55-day moving average, which is at 1,561.50 today.</p>
<p>Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) increased net purchases for the year so far to 3.24 million ounces as at last Friday, according to a Bloomberg report. Meanwhile, speculative investors turned net sellers of the precious metal for the first time in four weeks in the week to February 25, according to the latest data snapshot from CFTC.</p>

They reduced net long positions in silver during the week to February 25, pulling overall net long positions from near three-year highs.</p>
<p>Silver closed below the 200-day moving average on Friday for the first time since June 17 last year, and that moving average, which is at 17.0354 today, could act as a near-term technical resistance point.</p>
<p>The gold/silver (Mint) ratio surged higher last week on gold’s rise, hitting the highest level on record going back to mid-2006. Last month was the biggest monthly advance since September 2011, capping the second monthly climb in a row. Yesterday’s drop stopped a seven-day rally in its tracks.</p>

The monthly decline was the largest in nine months, and saw platinum hit six-month lows.</p>
<p>Exchange-traded funds increased net platinum holdings last week by 7,000 troy ounces, Bloomberg reported yesterday. Meanwhile, speculative investors reduced net long positions for a fourth consecutive week in the week to February 25, trimming them to the lowest since the week of December 10, according to CFTC data.</p><!--start-image-->

That snapped a five-day losing streak as expectations of lower rates from the central banks helped to lift the gloomy cloud above global growth and hence demand for industrial metals.</p>
<h3><strong>Agriculturals</strong></h3><p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-sugar-no11"" id=""5fc34c7105d5b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8869"">Sugar</a></span></strong> prices fell for a sixth straight day yesterday despite expectations of a hefty sugar supply shortage for the 2019/20 period. The International Sugar Organization has forecast that this season’s global deficit will be 9.4 million tons, the biggest in 11 years, as a result of lower output from Thailand amid heavy droughts in the country, and India. Increased production from Brazil and record output from Russia would not be enough to compensate for the shortfall.</p>
<p>However, speculative investors remain bullish on the commodity having boosted net long positions to the most since December 2016, according to the latest data from CFTC.</p><!--start-image-->

That makes me nervous because I think some of the assumptions people have made will be in the “<em>just ain’t so</em>” category.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Option markets price uncertainty via implied volatility (Vol.) In this chart of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/nq-100"" id=""5fc34e5cb9439"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""20"">Nasdaq 100</a></span> option Vol the spike during the March panic was the highest since 2008.

I hope the vaccines will stop the spread of the virus but there’s a huge gap between discovering vaccines and widespread effective vaccinations.</p>
<p>My view over the past several months has been that<strong> the virus will keep spreading</strong> and that will lead to economic weakness which will eventually weigh on bullish equity market psychology.</p>
<p><strong>I was short stock indices during the late October break</strong>, did nothing during election week and then got back to shorting again after the Pfizer (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/pfizer"" id=""5fc34e5cb9696"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""7989"">PFE</a></span>) vaccine rally.

<p>WTI crude oil has been highly correlated with the S+P over the last month. It tumbled the last 2 weeks of October then reversed sharply higher as November began. It surged ~$6 (16%) following the Pfizer news on hopes that the vaccine would spark a global demand rebound, especially for transportation fuels.</p>

<p><strong>My view has been that WTI has been a lack-of-demand story.</strong> Global demand is down ~10% this year from last year and OPEC+ is forecasting that demand for 2021 will be ~4% below last years’ demand. OPEC+ meets Dec. 1 and they will try to keep a lid on production. OPEC export revenue has fallen by ~2/3 since 2012 (2020 revenue ~$350B) so producers have no choice but to keep pumping.</p><h4>Commodity markets rally</h4><p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/copper"" id=""5fc34e5cb9b3b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8831"">Copper</a></span> ended this week at a 2-year high ~$3.30</strong> up &gt;50% from 4-year lows in March. <strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34e5cb9c35"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">Soybeans</a></span>&nbsp;hit a 4 year high</strong> just below $12 bushel, up ~50% from April lows.</p>

    </div>
        <p>Investing.com - U.S. corn futures rallied to a 13-month high on Friday, after the U.S. Department of Agriculture lowered their outlook for near-term supplies of the grain and cut their estimate of this year’s U.S. harvest.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc3475c1cddf"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">US corn</a></span> for September delivery hit an intraday peak of $4.3913 a bushel, a level not seen since June 30, 2014, before closing at $4.3460, up 6.0 cents, or 1.4%.</p>
<p>On the week, corn futures rose 8.5 cents, or 1.37%, the fourth straight weekly gain.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture said that U.S. corn inventories at the end of the 2014-15 season in August will total 1.779 billion bushels, down sharply from its June estimate for 1.876 billion and lower than market expectations of 1.810 billion bushels.</p>
<p>The cut reflected increased corn exports and greater usage by livestock producers, according to the USDA.</p>
<p>The agency said that it expects a harvest of 13.53 billion bushels of corn in the marketing year beginning this autumn, down from its June outlook for 13.63 billion, as farmers will plant less corn.</p>
<p>The USDA projected corn yields of 166.8 bushels an acre, unchanged from its previous estimate.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc3475c1d123"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">US soybeans</a></span> for August delivery tacked on 5.6 cents, or 0.56%, to settle at $10.3200 a bushel on Friday, after touching a daily high of $10.4820, the most since July 1.</p>
<p>The USDA said that domestic soybean stocks at the end of the 2014-15 season will total 255 million bushels, down from a previous estimate of 330 million bushels and below market expectations of 287 million.</p>
<p>The agency left its average yield estimate at 46 bushels per acre, unchanged from last month.</p>
<p>According to the USDA, farmers will harvest 3.885 billion bushels of soybeans in the 2015-16 season, up from 3.85 billion in its June outlook and above expectations for 3.794 billion bushels.</p>
<p>The agency pegged domestic soybean ending stocks next year at 425 million bushels, compared to an estimate of 475 million a month ago.</p>
<p>Despite Friday's gains, the August soybean contract lost 0.38 cents, or 0.52%, last week, halting six consecutive weeks of gains, as concerns over the health of China's economy weighed.</p>
<p>The Asian nation is the world’s largest soybean consumer.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the Chicago Board of Trade, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc3475c1d22e"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">US wheat</a></span> for September delivery fell to a session low $5.6840 a bushel, the weakest level since June 29, before ending at $5.7600, down 2.0 cents, or 0.35%. On the week, the September wheat contract dropped 10.38 cents, or 2.23%.</p>
<p>The USDA forecast domestic wheat output will total 2.148 billion bushels in the 2015-16 season that started June 1, up from 2.121 billion bushels estimated last month.</p>
<p>Domestic wheat reserves at the end of the 2015-16 season will total 842 million bushels, compared to a forecast of 814 million last month.</p>
<p>According to the USDA, global ending wheat inventories next season will rise to 202.4 million metric tons from an estimated 200.4 million tons in 2014-15.</p>
<p>In the week ahead, market players will focus on the release of key USDA data, including crop progress and weekly export sales figures.</p>
<p>Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, government figures show. Wheat was fourth, behind hay.</p>

Wilkerson says, “ It transition the gasoline supply in the country to a higher octane so greenhouse emissions could be reduced by 40 to 43% and increase your fuel efficiency. He says the research octane number or “RON” would be raised.”&nbsp; He further said, “when you pull up to the pump you would see a number that we’ve advocating for which is 98RON and it’s aimed at increasing efficiency in engines. To increase efficiency in engines you have to have more octane and when you get E25 and E30 that’s really where you see the seet spot for finding the most efficiencies.” In the overnight electronic session, the October ethanol posted a trade at 1.367 which is .037 higher.

<p>Understanding a niche fund's specific investment style is crucial before committing new capital since <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/volatility-s-p-500"" id=""5fc353b922226"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""44336"">volatility</a></span> of returns is likely to be elevated as the focus is on smaller markets or narrower asset classes.</p>
<p>Those with a company-focus are more affected by the general direction of the stock market, while ETFs that hold derivative products are impacted more by price movement around contract-expiration dates and the gearing that derivatives may offer.

<p>So far in the year, MOO is down about 1.5%, but since the lows in March, the fund jumped more than 60%. In fact, on Sept. 2, it made an all-time high of $69.43.

<p>Many analysts concur that MOO's 2019 and 2020 showings have both been impressive in spite of headline risks. MOO managed to gain 20.75% in 2019, even as US-China trade tensions ran high and important farming regions endured poor weather conditions. 2020 has been marked by the coronavirus pandemic and has seen disruption to supply chains and production as a result of various lockdown measures taken worldwide.

        <p>Investing.com - U.S. wheat futures extended strong gains from the previous session on Monday to hit a five-week high as concerns over the health of the winter-wheat crop combined with a broadly weaker U.S. dollar supported prices.</p>
<p>The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/us-dollar-index"" id=""5fc345257f0f9"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8827"">U.S. dollar index</a></span>, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, dipped 0.4% to 97.67 on Monday. The index ended last week down 2.53%, the biggest weekly loss since October 2011.</p>
<p>The dollar's losses came after the Federal Reserve downgraded its forecasts for growth and inflation and lowered its interest rate projections, prompting investors to push back expectations on the timing and pace of future rate increases.</p>
<p>A weaker dollar increases the appeal of U.S. crops to overseas buyers and makes commodities more attractive as an alternative investment.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc345257f48c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">US wheat</a></span> for May delivery touched a session high of $5.4038 a bushel, the most since February 18, before trading at $5.3688 during U.S. morning hours, up 6.47 cents, or 1.22%.</p>
<p>On Friday, the May wheat contract surged 18.0 cents, or 3.52%, to settle at $5.3000. Futures rose 27.0 cents, or 5.76%, last week, the second consecutive weekly gain.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Kansas winter wheat was rated 41% good to excellent as of last week, down from 46% in the previous week, while Oklahoma winter wheat was rated 40% good to excellent, compared to 42% in the previous week.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc345257f5a2"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">US corn</a></span> for May delivery tacked on 3.48 cents, or 0.9%, to trade at $3.8888 a bushel after hitting an intraday peak of $3.9113, the highest since March 12.</p>
<p>US corn for May delivery jumped 11.4 cents, or 3.08%, on Friday to close at $3.8500 as strength in wheat spilled over. Wheat and corn prices are linked because both can be used as animal feed.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the Chicago Board of Trade, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc345257f6af"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">US soybeans</a></span> for May delivery inched up 6.53 cents, or 0.67%, to trade at $9.8013 a bushel. Prices touched a daily high of $9.8163 earlier, the strongest level since March 13.</p>
<p>On Friday, US soybeans for May delivery advanced 12.0 cents, or 1.25%, to end at $9.7360.</p>
<p>Optimism over the outlook for supplies in Brazil and Argentina combined with indications over a slowdown in demand for U.S. soybeans have weighed on prices in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Brazil and Argentina are major soybean exporters and compete with the U.S. for business on the global market. Large South American crop prospects could weigh on demand for U.S. supplies.</p>
<p>Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, government figures show. Wheat was fourth, behind hay.</p>

Bloomberg reported that China has given waivers to several companies to buy at least two million tons of U.S. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34a25162db"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span> tariff-free. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that high-level talks will take place next month and the recent cancellation of farm visits by Chinese officials came at the request of the United States.</p>
<p>That seems to help defuse some of the worries that China had canceled the visits because the two-day deputy-level negotiations didn’t go well or some other problem arose to sour relations between the world’s two largest economies. </p>
<p></p><h3><a name=""_qxyuyrj5k5tv""></a><strong>Trade-sensitive Stocks Gain Ground</strong></h3>This morning, the fresh hope from the news flow seems to be helping the market some, boosting trade-sensitive stocks like Boeing (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/boeing-co"" id=""5fc34a2516679"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""238"">BA</a></span>), <span itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Corporation""><span itemprop=""name""> Caterpillar </span></span> (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/caterpillar"" id=""5fc34a251678f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""247"">CAT</a></span>) and chipmakers including Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/adv-micro-device"" id=""5fc34a25168c9"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8274"">AMD</a></span>). But equities may still find it hard to push through to new highs while the trade dispute remains unresolved.The trade fight between the world’s two biggest economies has dragged on for more than a year. As it has escalated to affect billions of dollars in U.S. and Chinese goods the dispute has become the biggest headwind holding back stocks and is arguably the main reason equities haven’t been able to reach above their record highs despite an accommodative Federal Reserve and signs of strength in the U.S. economy.  The bottom line: Real progress could be a boon to the market. Stalling and setbacks may continue to be a drag on economic growth. Until we see a meaningful breakthrough, the current holding pattern could continue. <h3><a name=""_3ujras7cmff6""></a><strong>PMI Data From Europe, U.S. Not Spectacular</strong> </h3><p>Yesterday was a light day for economic news, but a purchasing managers index from IHS Markit painted a picture of a eurozone economy that was “close to stalling” at the end of Q3 as “demand for <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/manufacturing-pmi-201"" id=""5fc34a2516d77"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""201"">goods</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/services-pmi-272"" id=""5fc34a2516e9d"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""272"">services</a></span> fell at the fastest rate in over six year.” </p>
<p>Meanwhile, data from the company showed that the United States saw a “muted upturn” in business activity during September. But that didn’t give investors too much to get excited about because the 51 reading for a measure of manufacturing and services output was weaker than the average of 55 seen over the past decade. </p>
<p>Both reports on the U.S. and eurozone economies cited the trade situation as cause for concern. (See more about manufacturing in the U.S. and eurozone below.) </p>
<p>In economic data today, investors are scheduled to see a report on U.S. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cb-consumer-confidence-48"" id=""5fc34a2516f89"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""48"">consumer confidence</a></span> a little later this morning. A Briefing.com consensus expects the headline figure for September to come in at 134, down from the prior reading of 135.1. The report can have high trading impact given how much of the economy – not to mention corporate profit – is driven by the consumer. The number could move the market if it’s much higher or lower than expected.</p>
<p>After the market closes, <span itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Corporation""><span itemprop=""name""> Nike </span></span> (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/nike"" id=""5fc34a25169f3"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8948"">NKE</a></span>) is expected to report its <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/nike-earnings"" id=""5fc34a2517170"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""erl"" data-pairid=""8948"">quarterly results</a></span>. While the consumer confidence figures are for the United States, NKE can be viewed as a bellwether for consumer discretionary spending domestically and abroad. Investors will also probably be paying close attention to language accompanying the release for any clues about the trade situation as China is a key area of sales for NKE, which also manufactures apparel and footwear in the Asian nation. </p><div class=""outerEleWrapper"">

</div><p><strong>FIGURE 1: UPWARD TREND. </strong>The U.S. dollar has been strengthening since early last year, helped in part by investors wanting the relative safety of the greenback as the U.S. economy has been seen as a relatively safe port amid a slowing global economy. The stronger dollar is great when traveling abroad or shopping for foreign-made goods, but it has ramifications for U.S. manufacturers. (See more below.) Data source: ICE (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/intercontintlex"" id=""5fc34a2516b0d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""7907"">ICE</a></span>). The chart above shows the general trend, target support and resistance lines via a linear regression channel.  Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. <em>For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.</em></p>
<p><strong>U.S. Factory Sector Expands ... </strong>Fresh data yesterday painted a more optimistic picture of the U.S. manufacturing sector than we’ve seen recently. The initial reading of the IHS Markit U.S. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/manufacturing-pmi-829"" id=""5fc34a25170a2"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""829"">manufacturing purchasing managers’ index</a></span> for this month hit 51, the highest reading since April. It was a welcome contrast to the August Institute for Supply Management manufacturing index which fell to 49.1 from just above 50 a month earlier and factored in to St. Louis Fed President James Bullard saying the U.S. manufacturing sector “already appears in recession.” The IHS Markit data may be indicating that the contractionary dip below 50 in the ISM data is just a blip. We’re scheduled to see the next ISM manufacturing index on Oct. 1, the same day that the final IHS Markit reading is due out.</p>
<p><strong>… While Europe’s Contracts:</strong>That said, all is not well in the world of manufacturing. In the U.S., IHS Markit said September’s initial reading represented “a modest overall improvement,” but manufacturers remained cautious about buying inputs, further reducing their purchasing activity. Pre-production inventory and stocks of finished goods were both lower as well. Things were worse abroad. In Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, the initial manufacturing PMI fell to 41.4 from 43.5 in August, marking “the sharpest decline in business conditions across the goods-producing sector since the depths of the global financial crisis in mid-2009.” For the eurozone as a whole, the initial manufacturing PMI dipped to 45.6 from 47 in August, hitting an 83-month low. “The goods-producing sector is going from bad to worse, suffering its steepest downturn since 2012, but a further worrying trend is the broadening-out of the malaise to the service sector, where the rate of growth has now slowed to one of the weakest since 2014,” IHS Markit said of the eurozone economy. </p>
<p><strong>The Big Picture: </strong>So what does all this mean for the U.S. economy, especially in light of the ongoing trade war with China? For one, it seems like U.S. factories remain a bastion as investors fret more about other parts of the world where manufacturing isn’t doing as well, including China, where the factory sector has been stuttering. While that might be a good sign for U.S. manufacturing, it’s also a double-edged sword. If U.S. factories continue to outperform other parts of the world and the U.S. consumer continues to remain resilient, that would likely help keep upward pressure on the U.S. dollar. That would make U.S. manufactured goods less competitive on the world market, but it might put a damper on commodity prices, perhaps decreasing input costs for factories. Whether one factor or the other would end up helping or hurting manufacturers, or whether they would be a wash, remains to be seen. </p>

<p>On the ethanol front, we traded a tad higher yesterday, with production slightly higher and weekly ending stocks down 2%.

Yesterday's Grain Stocks for corn came in at 5.224 billion bushels with the average estimates of 4.99 (bb) and the 1-Year 5.202 (bb), while the Acreage numbers came in at 92.01 million of acres which average estimates tagged at 9.521 (moa) and versus last year at 89.7 (moa). The lower corn acreage must have had farmers doing the happy dance, with funds reported buying 30,000 corn. Make no mistake: weather is going to play a key factor from here on out and some feel that it is too late to replant acreage. The question is… Will we have another after the 4th of July weekend selloff? Unless we see drought conditions which I highly doubt, we will see some selling come back in, but at the moment traders are riding this pony. You have to admit we have seen a rally with large trading ranges we have not seen in some time. But we also have to remember hot and humid weather is ideal growing conditions in corn that should make the crop thrive. The market continued the momentum in the overnight electronic session with the December corn currently trading at 354 ½ which is 4 cents higher. The trading range has been 355 to 3491/2.</p>

Sugar mills produced 8.46 billion liters of ethanol in May which more than doubled the 4.05 billion liters last year. This is clearly telling me that there are signs of life in this industry.

We will no doubt be following the storm's track as it makes landfall.</p>
<p>There has been plenty of rain in the Corn Belt and if the hot weather persists this week hopefully, it will soak up a lot of existing moisture if the track hits us head on and brings milder temperatures.

But questions over exports might be critical in determining if this play works again. In the overnight electronic session, July corn is currently trading at 322 cents per bushel, or 2 ¼ cents lower. The trading range has been 322-324 ½ , and we are looking at a continued tight trading range.</p>

Nebraska Ethanol Board Chairman Jan ten Bessel, also a farmer in Cambridge, Nebraska, says he is confident the ethanol industry will recover from the demand destruction caused by the coronavirus pandemic. “What were seeing today is a little bit of what agriculture would be without ethanol,” ten Bessel says. “But I believe this will come back, maybe slowly at first, but will come back.” He says Nebraska ethanol plants that were shut down are starting back up. “As people start driving again and people getting out, those supply lines are moving again.” The June ethanol expires today and there were no trades in the complex overnight. The July contract settled at 1.148 and is currently showing 1 bid at 1.123 and 1 offer at 1.165 with open interest at 114 contracts.</p>

We are already on the cusp of becoming the world's largest LNG exporter ahead of Qatar and Australia. Bloomberg reports that natural gas could be the next commodity to turn negative, given a glut in Europe that has caused hefty price-cutting. All of these factors weigh on prices and create a negative outlook for producers. Unlike the oil market, there has been no coordinated response to address the surplus and the fallout could be deeper and longer. However, the market has the wind in its sails this morning, most likely based on Tropical Storm Cristobal. In the overnight electronic session the July Natural Gas is currently trading around $1.825, around 3% higher. The trading range has been $1.771-1.822.</p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"
1606634800-5055,https://www.investing.com/commodities/us-soybeans-opinion/3,ETNs Are Not ETFs: Here's What You Need To Know,https://www.investing.com/analysis/interested-in-etn-investing-heres-what-you-need-to-know-200533917,"By Investing.com (Tezcan Gecgil/Investing.com )Stock MarketsAug 13, 2020 02:42AM ET","<p>After highlighting a range of Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) offering exposure to various asset classes, today&nbsp;we'll switch focus to&nbsp;another type of&nbsp;Exchange-Traded Product to consider: Exchange-Traded Notes (ETNs).</p>
<p>Below we&nbsp;breakdown down exactly how&nbsp;ETNs work and offer&nbsp;a&nbsp;commodities ETN&nbsp;worth watching:</p><h2><strong>What's An ETN?</strong></h2><p>An&nbsp;<strong>exchange-traded note</strong>&nbsp;is an unsecured debt security issued by a financial institution, usually a bank. Since an ETN's&nbsp;value is backed by the credit rating of the underwriting issuer, the price would likely decrease if the credit of the underwriter were to go down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most investors may feel confident that globally recognized issuers&nbsp;like <strong>Barclays (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/barclays-plc"" id=""5fc34d2839802"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""21053"">BCS</a></span>), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/morgan-stanley"" id=""5fc34d283a42c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8056"">MS</a></span>)&nbsp;</strong>and <strong>UBS&nbsp;(NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/ubs-group-n?cid=8132"" id=""5fc34d283a59a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8132"">UBS</a></span>)</strong> will&nbsp;always be able to repay the notes, but default risks do exist. For example,&nbsp;when the financial crisis of 2008 led to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, ETN investors at the time found themselves with unsecured claims in the bank's bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
<p>Like stocks and ETFs,&nbsp;ETNs also trade on major exchanges.&nbsp; ETNs&nbsp;track an index of securities, which&nbsp;may be tied to broad-based asset indices, emerging markets, commodities, volatility, foreign currencies, a specific industry or sector (such as oil and gas pipelines, biotechnology, consumer staples, or semiconductors)&nbsp;or other instruments. Therefore, returns usually&nbsp;depend on the performance of a market benchmark or strategy, minus any expense fees.</p>
<p>Unlike ETFs, ETNs are not&nbsp;registered investment companies, so investors&nbsp;do not actually own a share of the underlying portfolio of assets in the fund. Instead, they hold a bond-like certificate indicating the debt of the underwriter (e.g., the financial institution or the bank) to the holder of the ETN.</p>
<p>Similar to other debt securities, ETNs have a maturity date, but they are not intended to be held to maturity. ETNs generally do not make any interest payments like bonds, either.</p>
<p>Accordingly,<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>returns to an investor generally come from trading the ETN. Market prices of ETNs fluctuate like stocks or ETFs. ETN issuers calculate the value of the ETN using a described formula, rather than using net asset value as is the case with ETFs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An ETN issuer would publish a value at the end of each trading day, representing the amount the issuer would be obligated to pay the investor. However, market prices may vary from these published values if the syndicator has credit issues. Therefore, the price discrepancy is an&nbsp;important risk characteristic of ETNs.</p>
<p>Another difference between ETNs and ETF is trade volume, which tends to be much lower for most ETNs than comparable ETFs, so&nbsp;ETNs carry more liquidity risk.</p>
<p>Finally, in the US, investing in ETNs has different tax consequences than ETFs. Individuals need to do due diligence to find consider the potential tax implications given their specific circumstances.</p>

You still have to understand that farmers are reluctant to sell at these levels, and more crop sales to China on the horizon, and lower U.S. crop size, has been supportive, and we may see new buyers appear.

        <p>Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, May 14:</p>
<p><strong>1. Trump promises to talk with Xi at G20, expects success</strong></p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump said he plans to meet with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the meeting of G20 leaders on June 28 and 29. ""That'll be, I think, probably a very fruitful meeting,” he said.</p>
<p>Trump also <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/news/economy-news/china-us-have-wisdom-to-resolve-trade-dispute-says-beijings-top-diplomat-1867003"" id=""5fc34fba4ae1d"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""oal"" data-articleid=""1867003"">predicted</a></span> that the outcome of trade talks would come “in about three or four weeks.”</p>
<p>The Chinese government also said on Tuesday that <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/news/economy-news/china-us-have-wisdom-to-resolve-trade-dispute-says-beijings-top-diplomat-1867003"" id=""5fc34fba4afc0"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""oal"" data-articleid=""1867003"">both sides would continue to talk</a></span>, fueling hopes that the recent escalation in tensions could be halted.</p>
<p>The more optimistic tone appeared to resuscitate hopes for an eventual deal, although Trump had repeated his warning for Beijing to tone down its response. “There can be some retaliation but it can’t be very substantial,” Trump told reporters at the White House.</p>
<p>Beijing announced Monday that it would place tariffs on about $60 billion in U.S. imports in retaliation for American tariff increases on its products.</p>
<p>The U.S. Trade Representative’s office Monday released a list of about $300 billion worth of Chinese goods upon which the administration intends to levy tariffs of up to 25%, including smart phones and toys.</p>
<p><strong>2. Asian stocks fall, U.S. and European equities stable</strong></p>
<p>A broad selloff on Wall Street a day earlier - that caused the largest percentage drop in the Nasdaq this year and the worst performance in the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/us-30"" id=""5fc34fba460d8"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""169"">Dow</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/us-spx-500"" id=""5fc34fba46367"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""166"">S&amp;P 500</a></span> since Jan. 3 - sent <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/news/stock-market-news/asian-shares-hit-threeandahalf-month-low-as-trade-war-intensifies-1866950"" id=""5fc34fba4b790"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""oal"" data-articleid=""1866950"">Asian shares to a three-and-a-half month low</a></span> on Tuesday</p>
<p>They pared losses later, allowing European markets to make a modest recovery from Monday's close.</p>
<p>U.S. futures also turned positive following Trump's comments. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/us-30-futures"" id=""5fc34fba4644f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8873"">Dow futures</a></span> gained 140 points, or 0.6%, by 5:38 AM ET (9:38 GMT), <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/us-spx-500-futures"" id=""5fc34fba46532"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8839"">S&amp;P 500 futures</a></span> rose 19 points, or 0.7%, while <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/nq-100-futures"" id=""5fc34fba4660a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8874"">Nasdaq 100 futures</a></span> advanced 68 points, or 0.9%.</p>

<p><strong>3. Trump remarks cause price reversal across asset classes</strong></p>
<p>Most asset classes have been retracing Monday's moves a little after absorbing the initial shock of the trade conflict escalation.</p>
<p>After hitting their lowest level in more than a decade after two straight weeks of losses, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34fba469ae"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybean futures</a></span> staged a minor recovery on Tuesday. Retaliatory tariffs from China, the world’s largest importer, would likely hit the commodity, leaving U.S. farmers with high levels of unsold stock.</p>
<p>Demand for safe haven assets meanwhile faltered. The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-jpy"" id=""5fc34fba46bcf"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""3"">Japanese yen</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-chf"" id=""5fc34fba46c97"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""4"">Swiss franc</a></span> retreated from recent highs against the dollar, while <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc34fba46d50"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">gold futures</a></span> pulled back below $1,300, breaking a three-day winning streak.</p>
<p>U.S. bonds also lost their luster. The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/rates-bonds/u.s.-10-year-bond-yield"" id=""5fc34fba46e27"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""23705"">yield on the 10-year Treasury</a></span> recovered from below 2.4%, its lowest since March, to trade at 2.41%.</p>
<p><strong>4. Uber CEO warns of more tough times ahead for stock</strong></p>
<p>Uber (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/uber-technologies-inc"" id=""5fc34fba46ee0"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""1115848"">UBER</a></span>) Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi warned that the company's <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/news/stock-market-news/uber-shares-fall-for-second-day-after-illfated-ipo-lyft-follows-1866160"" id=""5fc34fba4c965"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""oal"" data-articleid=""1866160"">newly-listed stock could remain under pressure</a></span> in the coming months.</p>
<p>“Sentiment does not change overnight, and I expect some tough public market times over the coming months,” he admitted in a memo to staff after the company lost another 10.8% on Monday, its second day of trading. It's indicated to open up 2.4% at $38.00 a share, down 15.6% from its IPO price.</p>
<p>“We have all the capital we need to demonstrate a path to improved margins and profits,"" Khosrowshahi said.</p>
<p><strong>5. Oil prices drop ahead of OPEC report, inventory data</strong></p>
<p>Oil was on track for a fourth straight session of losses Tuesday ahead of the publication of OPEC’s monthly report and weekly data on U.S. crude inventories.</p>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc34fba46fa4"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">U.S. crude oil futures</a></span> lost 13 cents, or 0.2%, to $60.90 by 5:39 AM ET (9:39 GMT), while <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/brent-oil"" id=""5fc34fba4705a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8833"">Brent oil</a></span> slipped 6 cents, or 0.1%, to $70.17.</p>
<p>Investing.com's senior commodity analyst <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/analysis/commodities-week-ahead--opec-report-could-pressure-more-cuts-gold-to-swing--the-200420634"" id=""5fc34fba49674"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""pal"" data-articleid=""200420634"">Barani Krishnan</a></span> expects OPEC to “make a strong case to continue with production cuts in its monthly report ...as dominant member Saudi Arabia shows it isn’t in any mood to give up the high prices it has worked hard to acquire since the winter.”</p>
<p>Krishnan also noted that the monthly report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) on Wednesday “might also buttress OPEC’s argument by projecting weaker demand for oil.""</p>
<p>Soft demand amid relatively high global stockpiles would support Saudi’s arguments not to increase production. In that light, the American Petroleum Institute will report on weekly U.S. crude stockpiles later on Tuesday. For Wednesday’s official government data, consensus expects a draw of 2.13 million barrels.</p>    <div class=""clear""></div>"

    </div>
        <p>Investing.com - U.S. wheat futures extended strong gains from the previous session on Monday, as market players turned their attention to the release of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's prospective plantings report on Tuesday.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc345511f27a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">US wheat</a></span> for May delivery tacked on 2.73 cents, or 0.54%, to trade at $5.1113 a bushel during U.S. morning hours.</p>
<p>On Friday, wheat rallied 8.4 cents, or 1.7%, to settle at $5.0760 as lack of rainfall in the U.S. grain belt fuelled concerns over the health of the winter-wheat crop.</p>
<p>According to the USDA, Oklahoma winter wheat was rated 44% good to excellent, up from 40% in the previous week, while Texas winter wheat improved by 4% to 55%.</p>
<p>In Kansas, the top wheat-producing state, the wheat crop was rated 41% good to excellent, unchanged from the preceding week.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc345511f566"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">US soybeans</a></span> for May delivery advanced 2.78 cents, or 0.29%, to trade at $9.7038 a bushel as investors returned to the market in wake of recent losses.</p>
<p>US soybeans for May delivery hit $9.6500 on Friday, the weakest level since March 20, before ending at $9.6720, down 7.2 cents, or 0.74%.<br> <br>The May soybean contract dipped 7.38 cents, or 0.54%, last week, the fourth straight weekly loss, as optimism over the outlook for supplies in Brazil and Argentina drove down prices.</p>
<p>Brazil and Argentina are major soybean exporters and compete with the U.S. for business on the global market. Large South American crop prospects could weigh on demand for U.S. supplies.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the Chicago Board of Trade, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc345511f656"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">US corn</a></span> for May delivery shed 0.53 cents, or 0.13%, to trade at $3.9088 a bushel. On Friday, US corn for May delivery eased down 0.2 cents, or 0.06%, to close at $3.9100.</p>
<p>The USDA's prospective plantings report is likely to show farmers in the U.S. cut corn sowings this spring in favor of planting more-profitable soybeans.</p>
<p>Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, government figures show. Wheat was fourth, behind hay.</p>

<p>Contracts on the S&amp;P 500 flipped lower on the news, and look to upend what would have been a seventh day straight rally of the benchmark index, nearing its highest level since March 6.</p>

However, a pullback by the Pan-European index gave up half those gains.</p>
<p>Earlier, before the Bloomberg news broke, bulls were more consistent and forceful in Asia, with Hong Kong’s <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/hang-sen-40"" id=""5fc34c9fe5a53"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""179"">Hang Seng</a></span> surging, (+3.4%), on the momentary geopolitical stability, as President Donald Trump left room in his rhetoric for calm in his relationship with China.

<p>The benchmark sovereign bond found resistance by the 50 DMA, which flipped from its support since crossing over it on May 18.

The FOMC establishes short-term interest rates.</p>
<p>The Fed Funds Rate is a tool that allows the central bank to react to changes in the economic landscape. The committee made <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/central-banks/fed-rate-monitor"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""frl"">no changes</a></span> in the short-term rate as it remained at the zero to twenty-five basis point level, the lowest in history.</p>
<p>The Fed followed through on Chairman Powell’s <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/analysis/fed-bids-goodbye-to-phillips-curve-and-preemptive-interest-rate-hikes-200535780"" id=""5fc34d7026066"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""pal"" data-articleid=""200535780"">comment</a></span> from the Jackson Hole virtual conference in August. He told markets that the central bank will no longer consider a 2% target rate for inflation a line in the sand but would look for an average of 2% over time. The policy change will allow inflationary pressures to rise above the target rate for a “<em>period</em>.” Some committee members suggested that inflation could increase to 2.25% or even 2.50% before the Fed uses interest rate policy.</p>
<p>The central bank lowered short-term rates to zero percent earlier this year, fired bazookas of liquidity into the financial system, and employed quantitative easing to push rates lower further out along the yield curve. These policies, to encourage borrowing and spending and inhibit saving, are a reaction to the weak economy caused by the pandemic. The latest move to allow and even promote inflation to rise amounts to more bullish fuel for the commodities asset class.</p><h2><strong>Dollar Index bear market isn't bearish for commodity prices</strong></h2><p>The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/us-dollar-index"" id=""5fc34d70240f1"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8827"">Dollar Index</a></span> bounced over the past week and was trading at the 94.682 level on Friday, September 25. </p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img title=""Dollar Index Weekly"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic353c904f32462019616244d291f61b76.png"" alt=""Dollar Index Weekly""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Dollar Index Weekly</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p><em>Source, all charts: </em>CQG</p>
<p>As the weekly chart of the Dollar Index highlights, the US currency was trading at 94.640 after the recent recovery. The range in 2020 has been from a high of 103.96 in March to 91.925 on Sept. 1. At just over 94.60, at the end of last week, the dollar index was closer to the low than the high for this year.</p>
<p>The high was the highest level for the index that measures the value of the dollar against other world currencies since 2002. A flight to quality during the risk-off period in markets lifted the dollar, but it turned lower and fell steadily until early September. Currencies rarely exhibit significant price volatility as governments manage price variance to stabilize the global financial system. Even though the index bounced from its most recent low, the trend for the USD remains lower, and only a move above the 98 level would reverse the current path of the greenback.</p>
<p>Since the dollar is the world’s reserve currency, it's also the pricing benchmark for virtually all commodities. A weakening dollar typically supports higher raw material prices. The recent rise caused most commodities to move lower.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><strong>Stimulus and liquidity are bullish catalysts for raw materials going forward</strong></h2><p>The global pandemic caused the US central bank and its counterparts worldwide to slash short-term interest rates and inject unprecedented levels of liquidity into the global financial system. Following the example from the 2008 financial crisis, the central banks have used monetary policy to encourage borrowing and spending and inhibit savings to stimulate the economy.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, quantitative easing programs pushed rates lower and further out along the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/rates-bonds/10-2-year-treasury-yield-spread"" id=""5fc34d7024498"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""1141794"">yield curve</a></span>. The Federal Reserve told markets they would continue to use all of the tools at its disposal during the crisis and its aftermath. The Fed Funds rate is at zero percent, and the central bank installed a put under the bond market when it comes to asset purchases.</p>
<p>In August, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told markets the 2% target rate for inflation will now be an average rather than a line in the sand. At the September FOMC meeting, the Fed formalized the policy, which will encourage rising inflation. Meanwhile, government fiscal stimulus programs and central bank monetary policy increase the supply of money in the financial system. The bottom line is that the response to the coronavirus and economic contraction and the Fed’s toleration of higher inflation is bullish for commodity prices for the coming months and years.</p><h2><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>A risk-off period is an opportunity to add commodity exposure to portfolios</strong></h2><p>The fall tends to be a historically weak period for the stock market. Indeed, almost on cue, the leading indices began to experience selling pressure after reaching all-time highs in September.</p>
<p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img title=""S&amp;P 500 Futures Weekly"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic700a2583ae8412076db076a2185cc563.png"" alt=""S&amp;P 500 Futures Weekly""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">S&amp;P 500 Futures Weekly</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p>As the weekly chart of the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/us-spx-500-futures"" id=""5fc34d70245b4"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8839"">E-Mini S&amp;P 500 Futures</a></span> contract illustrates, the stock market hit a speed bump after reaching an all-time peak during the first week of September. The memories of the price action in February and March are causing selling in markets across all asset classes. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc34d70246bc"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">Gold</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/silver"" id=""5fc34d70247d1"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8836"">silver</a></span> prices have experienced significant corrections. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/copper"" id=""5fc34d7024915"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8831"">copper</a></span>, which rose to over $3.10 per pound for the first time since June 2018, was just below the $3 level at the end of last week. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc34d7024a0f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">Crude oil</a></span> corrected from the August high, and many other commodities have experienced selling pressure. The bounce in the dollar, which is likely another round of safe-haven buying, added to the bearish price action in the raw materials sector.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, markets rarely move in a straight line. Even the most aggressive bull markets experience corrective periods. Given the current economic landscape, the selling in the commodities asset class is likely to be another buying opportunity on the road to far higher prices over the coming years. A risk-off period would only prompt more stimulus from governments and central banks.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><strong>2008 through 2012 could be model for the coming years, but markets rarely move in a straight line</strong></h2><p>While each crisis is different, the tools to treat the impact often have similar results. In 2008, following the US housing crisis and European sovereign debt debacle caused central banks and governments to employ unprecedented levels of liquidity and stimulus to support the global financial system. From June through September 2008, the US Treasury borrowed a record $530 billion to fund the stimulus. In May 2020, they borrowed $3 trillion.</p>
<p>The US government is unlikely to agree on anything in the current political environment as the November 3 election approaches. The contest will determine if President Trump will win a second term or if former vice president Joe Biden will replace him in the Oval Office. The election will also decide the majorities in the House of Representatives and the Senate. The recent passing of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the President’s plan to nominate her replacement last weekend has only inflamed passions on both sides of the political aisle in Washington DC. While the chances of another stimulus package over the coming weeks have declined, the government’s need to act will force more stimulus in the aftermath of the election. The bottom line is that the US Treasury will be borrowing more in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p>Central bank and government policies that increase the money supply and the Fed’s toleration of rising inflation are policies that weigh on the purchasing power of money. The environment is extremely bullish for the commodities asset class. From 2008 through 2012, raw material prices moved from the risk-off period into a bull market that took most prices to multi-year highs and others to record levels.</p>
<p>Almost all sectors of the commodities market rallied over the four years. In 2011, gold and copper reached record highs. Crude oil moved back over $100 per barrel. Many agricultural commodities rose to multi-year highs in 2011 and 2012, with <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc34d7024b02"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">corn</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34d7024c1f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybean</a></span> prices reaching record levels in 2012 after a drought added to the bullish landscape for prices.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the cause of the turbulence in the economic landscape in 2020 is different from in 2008. However, the treatment and policies are the same, and the levels of liquidity and stimulus are far higher. Albert Einstein once said:</p><blockquote>
<p>“<em>Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results</em>.”</p>
</blockquote><p>Given the policies of governments and monetary authorities, Einstein would be very bullish on commodity prices for the coming years. Buying the dip in the raw materials sector could be the optimal approach during the current risk-off period.</p>
<p>The September FOMC meeting poured more bullish fuel over a smoldering fire in the commodities markets. The current correction creates an opportunity.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- Corn prices have been on an epic run. Now, soybeans could soon be catching up.</p>
<p>With more rains forecast for the U.S. Midwest, oilseed plantings are under threat and hedge funds are backing away from their bearish wagers. Meanwhile, corn is heading for its best quarterly advance since 2010 and the funds are betting there’s more room to run, raising their net-bullish holdings to the highest in a year.</p>
<p>Fields are still flooded, keeping farmers from seeding and threatening yields. Cooler and wetter-than-normal weather remains in the forecast. The U.S. Department of Agriculture will update its plantings estimate on June 28, but analysts and traders are already concerned the agency’s numbers will be too high and not fully reflect the impact of the deluge.</p>
<p>“Most people would suggest this survey is a little dated,” said Rich Nelson, chief strategist at Allendale Inc. in McHenry, Illinois, referring to the USDA report.</p>
<p>In the weeks and months ahead, the agency likely will have to take down estimates both for U.S. soy acreage and yield to reflect major planting delays, Nelson said. That could boost <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34fcf24bb4"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span> prices that lagged behind corn’s big run. Most-active rolling futures are heading for a gain of less than 6% this quarter, while the grain has surged about 28%.</p>
<p>Soybeans have trailed for a reason. In the U.S., the oilseed can be planted later in the spring than <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc34fcf24ef4"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">corn</a></span>. Amid the heavy rains, some analysts had forecast that the weather would eventually clear and farmers would plant more soy. That would’ve meant bigger production at a time when demand is already suffering amid the U.S.-China trade war.</p>
<p>But with more showers in the forecast, that scenario is becoming less likely.</p>
<p>“After the corn problem was realized, everyone started shifting their focus to beans,” Terry Reilly, senior commodity analyst at Futures International LLC in Chicago, said by phone.</p>
<p>As of June 18, investors slashed their soy net-short position by 39% from a week earlier to 55,307 futures and options, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed Friday. The figure, which measures the gap between bets on a price increase and on a decline, is the smallest since late March.</p>
<p>In corn, money managers raised their net-long position by 29% to 143,515 contracts. That’s the highest since May 2018.</p>
<p>For soybeans, the trade outlook will also loom large. Donald Trump and China’s Xi Jinping are expected to meet on the sidelines at the Group of 20 summit held in Japan starting June 28. Any signs of an easing in tensions could also spark a move higher in prices. China is the world’s top soy importer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, grain trading houses are positioning for a prolonged impact from the U.S. rains. Cargill Inc. said it’s initiated flood mitigation plans for grain facilities along the Mississippi and Illinois rivers.</p>
<p>“The impacts of the flooding and other events will continue through the 2019 growing season into harvest,” April Nelson, a Cargill spokeswoman, said in a statement Friday.</p>

Yet, that hasn’t been the case for OJ.&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr"">After a runaway 18% gain in March—its best in four years—orange juice futures suddenly lost 10% in April as supplies in warehouse freezers ran out, though those in stores didn’t. The disconnect was partly due to supply chain dislocations that had become all-too familiar during the pandemic. Unfavorable weather in top orange growing state Florida—and demand from a population that had unsurprisingly become more concerned about its health—also made it hard for farmers to keep up.</p><h2 dir=""ltr""><strong>Consumption Still Up After Lockdowns</strong></h2><p dir=""ltr"">In the commodities world, typically when supply runs out on something that’s hot in demand, its prices would go through the roof. Yet, in OJ’s case in April, the speculators long on the commodity on ICE Futures US simply cashed out of their profitable March positions, triggering the price crash.</p><p dir=""ltr"">But output from Florida has improved the past two weeks and being bullish on OJ is vogue again.</p><p dir=""ltr"">“Trends are still up in the market,” Jack Scoville, analyst at Chicago’s Price Futures Group, said, commenting about OJ after it hit $119.78 per lb on Wednesday, its highest since the March peak of $1.2255—which itself was an 11-month high.&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr"">Added Scoville:</p><blockquote>
<p dir=""ltr"">“Support is coming from the continued effects of the coronavirus that are keeping people drinking orange Juice. Demand from grocery stores has remained strong in response to the increased consumer demand. Supplies available to the market are somewhat reduced. Inventories in cold storage remain solid, so there will be OJ to meet the demand.”</p>
</blockquote><h2 dir=""ltr""><strong>Technical Indicators: OJ Is A “Strong Buy”</strong></h2><p dir=""ltr"">So, is it worth opening new long positions in OJ?</p><p dir=""ltr"">Yes, according to Investing.com’s Daily Technical Outlook, which calls the front-month July OJ contract a “Strong Buy”.</p><p dir=""ltr"">The technical indicator has a topside resistance of $1.2352 for July OJ, which settled Thursday’s trade at $1.2040. That potentially leaves room for another 3 cent, or 2.5%, gain—although in reality it could be more. OJ is already up 24% year-to-date.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Scoville’s own max for July OJ is $1.27, meaning a 7 cent or near 6% gain.&nbsp; He says his call is based on juice consumption remaining relatively high and the weather staying supportive in Florida.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Florida’s weather has been a mixed bag over the last few weeks: very hot and dry in the south, where most of its orange groves are, and wet in the north.&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr"">“The mid season oranges harvest is diminishing,” said Scoville. “Irrigation has been run several times per week in most areas. Color break is reported on late variety oranges. There are also more signs of early bloom, and new growth on trees are reported.”</p><p dir=""ltr"">According to the latest available Nielsen data, retail sales of orange juice rose 33.5% In the eight weeks ended April 18, compared with a year ago.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Orange juice consumption hit its peak in 1998, topping out at 6.1 gallons per capita, according to data from the US Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service. By 2017, consumers were drinking 60% less orange juice, following years of backlash given questions about its true health benefits and a wider variety of options of juices and smoothies.</p><p dir=""ltr"">The recent spike in consumption has been interpreted by analysts to mean that lockdowns incited by the coronavirus have made stay-home Americans eat fuller breakfasts—which include the typical tall glass of orange juice—versus reversing the trend of grabbing meals on the way to work.</p><p dir=""ltr"">If consumption of OJ remains high as Americans transition to a normal life, it’ll mean that whether they’re home or on the run, juice in the morning has become a must.</p>

Camri Nelson of Spectrum News, Cincinnati reported that lack of rain will cause declines in corn this year. Interviewing Kate Burwinkle, with Burwinkle Farms, she noted every rear Burwinkle Farms, a small retail and produce farm in Ross Township grows close to 100 acres of corn, but this year wasn’t the case due to cold weather. “ In May we had a real hard freeze and that was detrimental to our crops at the beginning of the season,” she said. Close to 25 acres of corn were affected, and they had a loss of about 8 acres.</p>
<p>“Our biggest weekend is usually at the end of July and we didn’t have enough corn to sell to our markets,” she said, “so we were running out of corn at the local stand and trying to keep that up and picking a little each day. According to the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation, the Burwinkles are not the only farmers who are dealing with this corn issue. “We're seeing more and more of the corn crop across Ohio get from excellent and good category down to the poor and very poor categories, so starting to see that corn slip as far, as it’s coming along,” said Ty Higgins, Ohio Farm Bureau Federation media relations.</p>
<p>And lack of rain is changing the way corn looks. “You won't see the corn getting as tall, you won't see the ears getting as full and that equates to a small number of bushels when it comes to harvest time,” Higgins said. This could lead to an interesting Crop Progress number later. December corn is currently trading at 336 which is 1 cent higher. The trading range has been 336 ½ to 332 ½.</p>

While the Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy (NDEE) is taking applications for a new grant program designed to encourage the installation of ethanol blender pumps across Nebraska. Expanding motorists’ access to higher blends of ethanol will increase usage of advanced biofuels and offer benefits to the state’s environment. Funding for the grants was made possible through a three-year $3 million award from the Nebraska Environment Trust. The grants made available to retail gas stations on a 50/50 cost share match for the acquisition of advanced biofuel blender pumps, fuel storage tanks, necessary infrastructure marketing and education. The pumps will provide various blends ranging from E-10 to E-85 to motorists. The numbers were supplied by Dave Strang, Nebraska Rural Radio Association. September ethanol posted a trade at 1.085 which is .065 lower. The market is currently showing 3 bids @ 1.030 and 1 offer @ 1.160 with 1&nbsp;contract traded and Open Interest at 63 contracts.</p>

<p>Traders are less willing to buy and sell long-dated futures because of increasing risks associated with trade wars and other geopolitical fissures springing up around the globe, Jeff Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman, said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. Instead, more activity is moving into the nearest month’s contract.</p>
<p>“The willingness of people that trade forward commodities has dropped because they’re scared about the future and they move up to the prompt or they go hand to mouth,” Currie said. “That dynamic is becoming increasingly prevalent across commodity markets.”</p>

        <p>Investing.com - U.S. soybean futures extended losses from the previous session on Tuesday to hit a one-week low amid improving crop prospects in the U.S. Midwest.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc3473d22c4c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">US soybeans</a></span> for August delivery fell to an intraday low of $10.1363 a bushel, the weakest level since June 30, before trading at $10.1563 during U.S. morning hours, down 6.38 cents, or 0.62%. A day earlier, prices of the oilseed lost 16.0 cents, or 1.54%, to close at $10.2220.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, nearly 63% of the soybean crop was in good to excellent condition as of July 3, unchanged from a week earlier and below the 72% recorded in the year-earlier period.  </p>
<p>Soybean emergence was 93% complete, improving from 89% a week earlier, while 21% of the crop bloomed, up from 8% in the preceding week.</p>
<p>Prices of the oilseed rallied to a seven-month high of $10.5460 on July 1 after the USDA said that U.S. farmers will plant 85.139 million acres of soybeans this year, compared with 83.701 million last year.</p>
<p>According to the USDA, domestic stockpiles at the beginning of June totaled 625 million bushels, up from 405 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>While the planting and stockpile estimates were both higher compared to a year earlier, the results came in below market expectations due to heavy demand for the oilseed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc3473d22f4a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">US wheat</a></span> for September delivery shed 5.38 cents, or 0.91%, to trade at $5.8762 a bushel early on Tuesday. Wheat slumped to a one-week low of $5.7220 on Monday before turning higher to end at $5.9540, up 5.0 cents, or 0.85%.</p>
<p>The USDA said Monday that nearly 55% of the U.S. winter-wheat crop was harvested as of July 5, up from 38% a week earlier. Approximately 55% of the crop was harvested in the same week last year, while the five-year average for this time of year is 59%.</p>
<p>About 40% of the U.S. winter-wheat crop was rated good to excellent as of last week, down from 41% in the preceding week. The agency also said that nearly 70% of the spring-wheat crop was in good to excellent condition, compared to 72% a week earlier.</p>
<p>Last week, the USDA forecast domestic wheat reserves as of June 1 at 753 million bushels, up from 590 million on the same date a year earlier. According to the agency, farmers in the U.S. will plant 56.079 million acres of wheat this year, compared with 56.822 million in 2014.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the Chicago Board of Trade, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc3473d23044"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">US corn</a></span> for September delivery inched up 0.93 cents, or 0.22%, to trade at $4.2312 a bushel in early trade on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Approximately 69% of the corn crop was in good to excellent condition as of June 21, according to the USDA, up from 68% in the preceding week. The five-year average is 75% for this time of year.</p>
<p>Corn hit a seven-month peak of $4.3060 on July 2 after the USDA estimated that U.S. farmers had planted 88.897 million acres of corn this year, down from 90.597 million last year.</p>
<p>A separate USDA report showed that domestic corn inventories totaled 4.447 billion bushels on June 1, compared with 3.852 billion bushels on that date last year.</p>
<p>Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, government figures show. Wheat was fourth, behind hay.</p>

        <p>Investing.com - U.S. wheat futures rose for the second consecutive session on Monday to move further away from a contract low as investors readjusted positions ahead of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s closely-watched monthly supply and demand report due on Tuesday.</p>

<p>On Friday, wheat for May delivery touched a contract-low of $4.7840 before turning higher to settle up 2.0 cents, or 0.42%, at $4.8240.</p>
<p>The May wheat contract tumbled 31.5 cents, or 5.81%, last week, the worst weekly loss since September, as concerns over ample global supplies and indications of reduced demand for U.S. wheat weighed.</p>

<p>US corn for May delivery shed 4.4 cents, or 1.15%, on Friday to end at $3.8600. Prices of the grain declined 6.76 cents, or 1.53%, last week.</p>

<p>US soybeans for May delivery fell to $9.7660 a bushel on Friday, the lowest since February 12, before ending down 0.4 cents, or 0.05%, at $9.8500, as concerns over Brazilian export prospects eased.</p>
<p>The May soybean contract slumped 44.74 cents, or 4.37%, last week, the first weekly loss in five weeks, as a two-week strike by Brazilian truck drivers appeared to be coming to an end.</p>
<p>Brazil is a major soybean exporter and competes with the U.S. for business on the global market, which could weigh on demand for U.S. supplies.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- Expectations the OPEC+ alliance will deepen output cuts put a floor under last week’s 16% plunge in oil prices, with futures in New York rebounding even as the coronavirus continued to spread rapidly.</p>
<p></p><p>Russia is ready to cooperate to support the world oil market, even though it’s comfortable with current prices, President Vladimir Putin said Sunday. That acted as a brake on plunging crude prices after a <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/manufacturing-pmi-594"" id=""5fc350ac46f8f"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""594"">Chinese manufacturing</a></span> gauge released over the weekend came in at a record low, undershooting already weak expectations and highlighting the mounting economic impact of the virus.</p><p></p>

Still, sharp swings in crude in Asian trading -- from a loss of 3.2% to a gain of 3.7% -- show the extent to which the virus is roiling markets.</p><p></p>
<p>Oil consumption may not grow at all this year for only the fourth time in almost four decades, according to a growing minority of traders, investors and analysts. While economic stimulus in China and elsewhere may revive demand in the second half, it’s unlikely to completely make up for the current hit to consumption. Against this backdrop, OPEC+ meets on Thursday and Friday in Vienna to decide on the extent of production cuts.</p>
<p>“Oil is on a wild ride today with bigger expectations for OPEC+ to reduce production in its meeting this week countered by the risk on consumption coming from the coronavirus outbreak,” said Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at AxiCorp Ltd. But any OPEC+ bounce will likely be short-lived until the virus starts subsiding, he said.</p>

That came after the manufacturing PMI reading over the weekend of 35.7, which compared with analyst expectations for 45. Worldwide deaths from the coronavirus have now surpassed 3,000, with South Korea, Iran and Italy emerging as hotspots.</p><p></p>
<p>Putin said the OPEC+ mechanism “has already established itself as an effective tool in ensuring long-term stability in global energy markets.” The fact that Russia has large financial reserves to cushion market turbulence “doesn’t eliminate the need for action,” he said. That represents a change in tone from Moscow, which had previously been cautious on deeper output cuts.</p>
<p>“We think Saudi Arabia will likely be able to rally the rest of the producers for a cut of at least 1 million barrels a day,” Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note. Current prices do not work for most of the OPEC+ group and Russia isn’t as price-agnostic as it endeavors to seem, she said.</p><!--start-image-->

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- Prices for U.S. farm exports dropped in July by the most in more than six years as a trade war with China heated up, Labor Department figures showed Tuesday.</p>
<p>Agricultural export prices fell 5.3 percent from the prior month, the biggest drop since October 2011, as <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34f85f0580"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybean prices</a></span> plummeted 14.1 percent. Export prices for corn, wheat, fruits and nuts also slumped in July. The overall export price index dropped 0.5 percent, the most since May 2017, the department said. The figures exclude the price effect from any tariffs.</p>
<p>China in July slapped 25 percent tariffs on American soybeans and also targeted other farm goods in retaliation for U.S. duties on a range of merchandise. The world’s biggest buyer of soybeans has shunned U.S. supplies amid the escalating trade conflict, threatening to curb exports after the harvest.</p>
<p>The report also showed that import prices were unchanged from the previous month, matching the median estimate of economists. Prices were up 4.8 percent from a year earlier, the biggest advance since 2012, driven by a 40.7 percent rise in fuel import prices.</p>

President Trump also reassured investors by saying the China trade deal was still intact, after comments by his trade advisor Peter Navarro spooked the markets by suggesting the agreement was “over.” After Trump's remarks, Navarro back tracked and the market took off and never looked back.

The report also said that excess production capacity and reduced demand will force the US ethanol industry to, “transform its business model to create more value and improve its operational efficiency.” CoBank predicts that consolidation within the companies will lead to longer and more financially stable companies with diversified ethanol co-product offerings by 2025.</p>
<p>“While ethanol remains an attractive business with long-term potential, the industry will need to evolve and diversify beyond fuel ethanol,” says Kenneth Zuckerberg, CoBank lead grain and farm supply economist.</p>
<p>He continues:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“That diversity will need to include higher-margin co-products like high protein distillers grains for animal feed, liquid carbon dioxcide for refrigeration, beverage grade alcohol and other industrial products. With the demand destruction we witnessed beginning in March, and now we are seeing people getting out and driving with some going back to work we are seeing a light at the end of the tunnel.""</p>

The key operational safeguards will require tank cars to be outfitted with “an enhanced thicker carbon steel outer tank,” and improved braking. It is also requiring “remote monitoring of the pressure and location of LNG tank cars.” In the overnight electronic session the July Natural Gas is currently trading at 1.647 which is .017 lower.

If so, it would be a new high for the year. No fewer than 11 Fed official speak next week, including all four of the five voting presidents and two governors.</p>
<p><strong>European reports include <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/m3-money-supply-198"" id=""5fc349f3269aa"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""198"">money supply</a></span>, confidence surveys, and flash PMI. </strong>The ECB's <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/analysis/ecbs-draghi-throws-down-gauntlet-to-berlin-but-leaves-the-duel-to-lagarde-200464252"" id=""5fc349f324fef"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""pal"" data-articleid=""200464252"">die is cast</a></span>. The market is trying to digest the implication of the new measures. We caution against drawing hard and fast conclusions about the weak reception to the new Targeted Long-Term Refinancing Operation. We suggest reserving judgment until after the next tranche which will be available in December after the tiering (exempts some ECB deposits from negative rates).</p>
<p><strong>Japan's course is not as clear, but the issue will not revolve around the flash PMI or leading economic indicator. </strong>The fulcrum is the yield curve and the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-jpy"" id=""5fc349f321d7f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""3"">yen</a></span>.

It reached its best level since August 1 before pulling back. Next week's highlight may be Trump and Abe meeting on the sidelines of the UN's opening session to ostensibly sign a preliminary trade agreement. It is an executive agreement, which means that the U.S. Congress does not need to ratify it, as it does the NAFTA 2.0. The sales tax increase on October 1 from 8% to 10% looms.</p>

The former is expected to cut, but the latter is not. The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/rbnz-interest-rate-decision-167"" id=""5fc349f3271ba"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""167"">Reserve Bank of New Zealand</a></span> meets, and although it is not expected to cut rates now, the market has about 20 bp cut discounted for November. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/interest-rate-decision-457"" id=""5fc349f327551"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""457"">Czech</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/interest-rate-decision-452"" id=""5fc349f327927"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""452"">Hungarian</a></span> central banks meet, and neither is likely to change policy. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/interest-rate-decision-497"" id=""5fc349f327e20"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""497"">Colombia</a></span> is expected to keep policy on hold. <strong>Banixco, Mexico's central bank, surprised investors last month by cutting the overnight rate by 25 bp to 8.0%. </strong>The market leans toward another 25 bp rate cut. The derivatives market suggests about 18 bp of easing has been priced in.</p>
<p>Instead of high-frequency data, the investors and businesses will likely take their cues from the evolution of several larger issues. Below is a sketch of our views:</p>
<p><strong>U.S.-China Trade:</strong>  A preliminary agreement is possible because China needs <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc349f3222e4"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soy</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/lean-hogs"" id=""5fc349f3223e6"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8913"">pork</a></span>, and the U.S. needs for the uncertainty to be lifted or risk the historic-long expansion. It does not change the underlying dynamic that we think is pushing toward disengagement: not entirely and not overnight. <em>Chimerica</em> was really two ships passing in the ocean. It was a naive (and arguably dangerous) illusion. Nationalism and national security interests are in ascendancy over the interests of economic efficiency. The bean counters argue that because the trade imbalance is so extreme in China's favor, the U.S. dominates the trade escalation ladder. They do not adjust for quality. The rare earths the U.S. buys from China cost less than a couple hundred million dollars—a rounding error of the bilateral flows. Consider how many years a ban on Chinese inputs for U.S. government and military drones will set the U.S. back. Consider that the last facility that produced penicillin in the U.S. closed 15 years ago and that the U.S. is nearly entirely reliant on China for antibiotics, including what is used for anthrax (ciprofloxacin).</p>
<p><strong>Federal Reserve Policy:</strong>   It is important to keep clear what one thinks the Fed <em>ought</em> to do and what it <em>will</em> do. We are sympathetic to the argument that the economic and financial conditions do not require easier policy. What is sold as low-cost insurance to extend the expansion may prove quite expensive if it only encourages leverage and financialization. However, we expect the Fed to <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/central-banks/fed-rate-monitor"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""frl"">cut rates</a></span> one more time this year. The dramatic funding squeeze dominated attention more so than the second rate cut of the year. The Fed has pre-announced overnight refi operations through October 10 and three 14-day term operations that carry over into October. These measures will do two things:  1) demonstrate that the Fed has the tools and will to control the very short-end of the yield curve, and 2) ease the quarter-end pressures. Powell indicated that at the October meeting that there likely will be sufficient information about the demand for reserves to make some decisions next month. The Fed could decide to continue the overnight repo operations to address periodic dislocations,  a standing repo facility, and/or allowing the balance sheet to grow organically again (as it did historically until 2007). Although some, including Simon Potter, who ran the Fed's market desk until mysteriously being let go earlier this year (without a permanent replacement being named yet), suggest that a resumption of QE <em>may</em> be necessary. We suspect this it will be the last resort rather than the go-to move now. It would confuse investors between monetary policy and these ""plumbing""  issues. We suspect that all things being equal, it would be better to keep the focus on the plumbing in October and return with the third cut in December, ahead of year-end,</p>
<p><strong>Brexit:  </strong>It seems like it has been one blunder after another since the referendum was first proposed as non-binding, which meant there were few rules (such as a required margin). What rules there were seemed to be recognized more in their violation than respect. Article 50, the decision to leave the EU, was made before there was an agreement among the representative of the people (House of Commons) on how best to implement the flawed referendum's results. The cart went ahead of the horse. At the heart of the problem is that leaving the EU conflicts with another UK obligation under the Good Friday Agreement, which commits to no hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. When the UK leaves the EU, a hard border to check people and goods crossing must be drawn. The open-ended backstop was to force a reconciliation of the conflicting demands. Next week is likely another week of pussyfooting around. The real crunch comes after the Tory Party Conference. Johnson will have a week or two to convince the EU. According to PredictIt.Org, the market sees the UK leaving at the end of October as currently slated at about a 1-in-3 chance, At the end of August, it was slightly favored (57%). Although EU policymakers seem to be as prepared as possible for the UK to leave, a plea for a final three-month extension to hold an election would likely carry the day.</p>
<p><strong>Hong Kong:</strong>  Unlike previous demonstrations in the Special Administrative Region, including the Umbrella Movement (2014), the current protests mark a turning point. Concessions from Hong Kong officials have been too small. The protesters have been emboldened and are demanding the free election of the Chief Executive. It seems more than Beijing can allow, and Chief Executive Lam is its hand (and fist) in HK. China appears torn between using its own anti-riot police (not the army, though the distinction in terms of force may be without a difference) and having Lam trigger the Emergency Powers, which seem to be almost like martial law. The point at which the situation could be resolved before the early October holiday and the commemoration of the 1949 Revolution has been passed. Although Chinese President Xi is the most powerful leader since Mao, he reportedly faces two important criticisms: the handling of HK and prematurely antagonizing the U.S. (<em>can't hide an elephant behind a tree).</em> Economically, the protests will drive HK into contraction. We have argued that the so-called internationalization of the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-cny"" id=""5fc349f322511"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""2111"">yuan</a></span> has really been more a Sino-ification of Hong Kong. The demonstrators in HK are determining the timing, and it might not be ideal for China, but we have long expected Shanghai would supplant HK as the main financial center for the PRC. To be sure, it won't happen overnight, and again this year, speculators anticipating a break of the peg have been rebuffed.</p>
<p><strong>Negative Interest Rates:</strong>  Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan recently suggested that due to demographics, it is only a matter of time before the U.S. too experiences negative interest rates. This is certainly possible, but the reason Europe and Japan have negative interest rates is not because of demographic considerations. They have negative interest rates because their policymakers chose to introduce a negative deposit rate. Asset purchases by themselves as the U.S. and UK experience shows does not necessarily lead to negative interest rates. In addition to a policy choice, the other shared characteristic of countries with negative interest rates is they have current account surpluses. The Great Financial Crisis forced central banks to develop new playbooks. Not all the measures and approaches are understood to have been successful. We think the jury is still out, and notably, the analysis that led the U.S. to reject it during the crisis continues to hold sway, judging from Chairman Powell's comments. A firm conclusion may be premature until a country has emerged from negative rates. Negative rates are were chosen to address a problem. The underlying problem remains. One way to think frame the problem is that the long-term fed funds equilibrium range rate or r* is below the inflation target. Currently, and after several years of gradually being reduced, the median Fed forecast is that long-term equilibrium rate is 2.50% and no one estimates that it is below 2.25%. What if it is closer to 1.50%?  The Bank of Japan has become the largest holder of JGBs and ETFs in its quest to push <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/national-core-cpi-344"" id=""5fc349f3281bd"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""344"">core inflation</a></span> (CPI <em>minus</em> fresh food) to 2%, which it has singularly failed to achieve. Its r* is surely below its inflation target.</p><div class=""outerEleWrapper"">

The Bloomberg chart above shows the real broad traded-weighted dollar index in white and the inverse of the euro in yellow (i.e., euros per dollar rather than dollars per euro). The three big dollar rallies since the end of Bretton Woods are clear. The real TWI ended last year at 102. Seemingly unbeknownst to many, it remained below there until last month, when it closed nearly at 102.5. <strong>We have suggested that the third one (Obama-Trump) is over or nearly so. </strong>Our argument is three-fold. First, the policy-mix has changed from tight monetary-loose fiscal, which is most supportive for a currency to its opposite. Second, we find that the last phase of a long-term dollar rally is often characterized by interest rates differentials moving against it. Two-year interest rate differentials have been moving against the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/rates-bonds/u.s.-2-year-bond-yield"" id=""5fc349f3228c3"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""23701"">U.S.</a></span> ( vs. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/rates-bonds/germany-2-year-bond-yield"" id=""5fc349f3229d6"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""23685"">Germany</a></span>, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/rates-bonds/uk-2-year-bond-yield"" id=""5fc349f322ada"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""23665"">UK</a></span>, and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/rates-bonds/japan-2-year-bond-yield"" id=""5fc349f322bbc"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""23893"">Japan</a></span>) since last November. The U.S. 2-year premium over <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/rates-bonds/canada-2-year-bond-yield"" id=""5fc349f322cbc"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""25270"">Canada</a></span> recorded a 12-year peak in March near 85 bp. By earlier this month, it had fallen to below five basis points before consolidating. Third, the by most measures of valuation, the greenback is rich. OECD currencies rarely move beyond 25% of its model of purchasing power parity. Near $1.1025, the euro is about 23% undervalued according to the OECD. Only the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-chf"" id=""5fc349f322db5"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""4"">Swiss franc</a></span> (~16.5%) and the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-nok"" id=""5fc349f322e9f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""59"">Norwegian krone</a></span> (~11.5%) are overvalued by this measure.

<p dir=""ltr"">“On the industrial side of things, one part of silver creates seven kinds of industries, from power generation to mining, trucking, metal refining, storage, product making and retailing.&nbsp; And if Vice President Biden gets to the White House, he wants to do this kind of Euro-style vehicle emissions, and wants to fight climate change with lots of solar power, wind power, all types of things that require silver.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote><h2 dir=""ltr"">“Won’t Blink An Eye” If Silver Gets To $50</h2><p dir=""ltr"">A “realistic, inflation-adjusted” price for silver would be $30 an ounce, Streible said.&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr"">“I wouldn’t be surprised if (silver) finished the year at $30,” he said, after the price hit an eight-year high of $26.28 an ounce this week. “I wouldn’t even blink an eye if it got to $40 or $50, given its relative undervalue to gold.”</p><p dir=""ltr"">Streible said the only way that either silver or gold would get “sucker-punched” was if a safe, working vaccine was delivered to the market tomorrow.</p><p dir=""ltr"">He said:</p><blockquote>
<p dir=""ltr"">“That could take silver back to the $16-$18 range.”</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">“But you’ll need more than the vaccine. You’ll also need the Fed to unwind its lending programs and that’s not going to happen overnight. Even with the Fed on de-stimulus mode, gold will probably go back to around $1,750 to $1,800 for a start. The bears may not get the precious metals meltdown that they want.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote><p dir=""ltr"">Christopher Lewis, an independent metals analyst who blogs at FX Empire, says it’s just not worth standing before the freight train that is the silver rally:</p><blockquote>
<p dir=""ltr"">“Quite frankly, this is a market that you should never consider selling, at least not anytime soon and considering that the Federal Reserve is looking to liquefy the markets going forward, it is a bit difficult to understand how somebody will think shorting silver is a good idea.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">“I think at this point the Federal Reserve will continue to add liquidity to the markets, driving down the value of the US dollar. That in turn drives up the value of precious metals and I think that is essentially what we are looking at here.”</p>
</blockquote><p dir=""ltr"">Silver bulls got a bit of a scare on Thursday, as the price fell by almost 4%, caught up in a broad push lower across the commodities complex that swept even gold lower, albeit by a modest 0.6%&nbsp;But the downdraft barely lasted one session.&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr"">On Friday, silver was already up by nearly 4% on the day, while gold finally touched the magical $2,000-an-ounce mark for the first time in history. Even then, it has still not kept pace with silver's gains so far this month. Gold has risen by almost 11%, its largest monthly increase since January 2012.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Lewis said:</p><blockquote>
<p dir=""ltr"">“Longer-term, I think that the silver markets (will) go much higher, but we may need to cool off a bit in order to attract more value oriented traders. I have no interest in shorting this market, regardless of what it does next. At the very least we need to consolidate a bit before picking up the pace again. Longer-term, silver is going to go much higher.”</p>
</blockquote><h2 dir=""ltr"">Declines Bought Up Quickly</h2><p dir=""ltr"">He said any decline in silver was likely to be bought up quickly.</p><p dir=""ltr"">“It will probably fall rather hard at one point or another, but ultimately, we should see the buyers takeover. I think looking for dips makes the most sense and I would be especially interested near the $22 level. The $20 level underneath should continue to be very supportive, and if we would somehow get down there it is likely that we could find plenty of buying pressure.”</p><p dir=""ltr"">Eli Tesfaye, precious metals strategist at RJO Futures, agrees:</p><blockquote>
<p dir=""ltr"">“Any pullback in silver is seen as an opportunity to buy rather than sell, in my view ... Highs are not in yet in my view.”</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">“The gold/silver ratio is still below the 10-year average of 85.30. The trend is your friend.”</p>
</blockquote><p dir=""ltr"">The gold:silver ratio is calculated by dividing the price of gold by that of silver. On Friday, the ratio was at 1:81, meaning it currently costs 81 ounces of silver to buy one ounce of gold.&nbsp;The ratio hit a record high of nearly 1:127 in mid-March, when gold was at around $1,704 versus silver’s 11-year low at $11.65. The measure has, otherwise, averaged 1:56 for decades.</p><p dir=""ltr"">“The silver ratio to gold is still way above what it should be,” Streible said. “It should go back to the average of around 1:60. I expect silver to continue outperforming gold on a relative basis.”</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> <em>Barani Krishnan does not own, or hold positions in, the assets he writes about.</em></p>

        <p></p><p>Investing.com – Stocks overall struggled on Monday, but the Dow was pushed higher by gains in Boeing and  Walgreen Boots Alliance.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/us-spx-500"" id=""5fc34796569d7"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""166"">S&amp;P 500</a></span> fell 0.2%. The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/nasdaq-composite"" id=""5fc3479656e90"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""14958"">Nasdaq Composite</a></span> was off 0.13%, while the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/us-30"" id=""5fc3479657030"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""169"">Dow Jones industrials</a></span> rose 0.04%.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>The Dow's gain came because Boeing (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/boeing-co"" id=""5fc3479657179"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""238"">BA</a></span>) jumped 4.6% after saying it believes its 737 Max will win recertification from the Federal Aviation Administration by the end of the year, with deliveries reportedly starting in December. It would take two months or so before the planes -- new and grounded -- could go into service.</p>
<p>Walgreens (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/walgreen-co"" id=""5fc3479657321"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8355"">WBA</a></span>) rose 5.1% on a Bloomberg News report that buyout giant KKR was considering offering to take the company private.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>The two stocks alone added nearly 129 points to the blue-chip index by themselves A 0.6% gain for Apple (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/apple-computer-inc"" id=""5fc3479657a74"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""6408"">AAPL</a></span>) added another 14 points with a 0.8% gain, but the other <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/eur-jpy"" id=""5fc3479657bbd"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""9"">Dow</a></span> components, especially 3M (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/3m-co"" id=""5fc3479657cd7"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""277"">MMM</a></span>), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/goldman-sachs-group"" id=""5fc3479657e03"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""266"">GS</a></span>), UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/united-health-group"" id=""5fc3479657f1b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8359"">UNH</a></span>) and Walt <span itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Corporation""><span itemprop=""name""> <span itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Corporation""><span itemprop=""name""> Disney </span></span> </span></span> (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/disney"" id=""5fc347965804e"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""258"">DIS</a></span>), pulled back enough to offset the first three.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>The reason for the pullback for the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq was more worries about a U.S.-China trade deal. There was nothing announced Monday, and all traders had to work with were comments last week from President Donald Trump. The first came on Friday when he said he hadn't signed off on rescinding tariffs, set to take effect on Dec. 15. And, while he tweeted Saturday talks were ""progressing nicely,"" that wasn't enough for traders and their computers.</p>
<p>For the past few weeks, the market has been treated with mostly positive news about a deal with a first phase deal signed next month.</p>
<p>The lack of news hasn't threatened the short-term rally that began in September. But it did seem to limit upside gains on Monday after record closes for the major indexes on Friday. In addition, there were no economic reports on Monday because of the Veterans Day Holiday.</p>
<p>Only Apple (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/apple-computer-inc"" id=""5fc347965816a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""6408"">AAPL</a></span>) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/microsoft-corp"" id=""5fc347965827a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""252"">MSFT</a></span>) hit new highs among the Dow stocks on Monday. </p>
<p>Others hitting new intraday highs on Monday were farm-equipment maker Deere (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/deere---co"" id=""5fc3479658397"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""261"">DE</a></span>), Sirius XM (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/sirius-satellite-radio-inc"" id=""5fc347965851b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""6427"">SIRI</a></span>), <span itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Corporation""><span itemprop=""name""> <span itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Corporation""><span itemprop=""name""> Toyota </span></span> </span></span> (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/toyota"" id=""5fc347965863b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8321"">TM</a></span>), autoparts maker BorgWarner (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/borgwarner"" id=""5fc34796587e6"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""19693"">BWA</a></span>), <span itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Corporation""><span itemprop=""name""> <span itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Corporation""><span itemprop=""name""> United Rentals </span></span> </span></span> (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/united-rentals"" id=""5fc3479658922"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""32516"">URI</a></span>) and specialty vehicle maker Oshkosh (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/oshkosh-corporati"" id=""5fc34796590f5"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""13090"">OSK</a></span>).</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>Oil prices moved lower as well. Oil traders believe a deal will boost global oil demand and cut inventories of crude oil in the United States and abroad. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc347965923f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">West Texas Intermediate</a></span> crude fell 38 cents to $56.86 a barrel. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/brent-oil"" id=""5fc3479659364"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8833"">Brent</a></span> crude, the global benchmark, dropped 33 cents to $62.18.

</div><p>On September 30, Chinese companies purchased 600 thousand tons of soybeans in the United States for delivery in November-January. This is slightly less than a week earlier, when 1 million tons were purchased. Market participants believe that purchases will continue. The acquisition of American soybeans is an important part of China’s commitment to the United States to end the trade war between the two countries, which has been going on for 15 months. Recall that the next round of US-Chinese trade negotiations may begin on October 10 or earlier. Safras &amp; Mercado reported a delay in Brazil's soybean planting season in the 2019/20 growing season. As of September 27, only 0.9% of the planned area was sown, while a season earlier on the same date it was 4.9%. An additional positive factor for soybean quotations was the publication of a review of grain crops U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Last year, the US bean crop was revised down to 4.428 billion bushels from 4.544 billion. At the same time, the USDA reduced the estimate of current soybean stocks in the United States to 913 million bushels, while market participants expected 982 million bushels.</p>
<p></p><p>On the daily timeframe, <strong>Soyb: D1</strong> exceeded the 200-day moving average line. Various technical analysis indicators have generated uptrend signals. Further growth of quotations is possible in the event of a decrease in world crops and an increase in US soybean imports to China.</p><p></p>
<p></p><li>The <strong>Parabolic indicator </strong>gives a bullish signal.</li><p></p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>The <strong>Bolinger® bands</strong> narrowed, indicating volatility decrease. Both Bollinger Lines Slope Up.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p></p><li>The <strong>RSI indicator</strong> is above the 50 mark. It has formed a divergence to increase.</li><p></p>
<p></p><li>The <strong>MACD indicato</strong>r shows uptrend signal.</li><p></p>
<p>The bullish momentum may develop if <strong>Soyb</strong> exceeds three of its last maximum: 918. This level can be used as an entry point. The initial stop lose may be placed below the last lower fractal, the lower Bollinger line, the 200-day moving average line and the Parabolic signal: 858. After opening a pending order, the stop shall be moved following the Bollinger and Parabolic signals to the next fractal minimum. Thus, we are changing the potential profit/loss to the breakeven point. More risk-averse traders may switch to the 4-hour chart after the trade and place a stop loss moving it in the direction of the trade. If the price meets the stop level (858) without reaching the order (918), we recommend to cancel the order: the market sustains internal changes that were not taken into account.</p>

        <p>Investing.com - U.S. soybean futures fell for the fourth consecutive session on Friday to hit a one-week low as optimism over the outlook for supplies in Brazil and Argentina drove down prices.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34540e2e72"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">US soybeans</a></span> for May delivery touched an intraday low of $9.6500 a bushel, the weakest level since March 20, before ending at $9.6720, down 7.2 cents, or 0.74%.</p>
<p>On the week, the May soybean contract dipped 7.38 cents, or 0.54%, the fourth consecutive weekly loss.</p>
<p>Brazil and Argentina are major soybean exporters and compete with the U.S. for business on the global market. Large South American crop prospects could weigh on demand for U.S. supplies.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc34540e316b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">US corn</a></span> for May delivery eased down 0.2 cents, or 0.06%, on Friday to close at $3.9100 a bushel.</p>
<p>Despite Friday's modest decline, the May corn contract tacked on 5.5 cents, or 1.62%, the second straight weekly gain.</p>
<p>On Thursday, prices rallied to $3.9700, the most since January 13, before closing at $3.9120, down 3.6 cents, or 0.95%.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the Chicago Board of Trade, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc34540e33c9"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">US wheat</a></span> for May delivery jumped 8.4 cents, or 1.7%, on Friday to settle at $5.0760 a bushel by close of trade. A day earlier, futures hit $4.9820, the lowest since March 16, before settling at $4.9920, down 19.6 cents, or 3.81%.</p>
<p>For the week, the May wheat contract tumbled 26.0 cents, or 4.22%, amid easing concerns over winter-wheat crop conditions in the U.S.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Oklahoma winter wheat was rated 44% good to excellent, up from 40% in the previous week, while Texas winter wheat improved by 4% to 55%.</p>
<p>In Kansas, the top wheat-producing state, the wheat crop was rated 41% good to excellent, unchanged from the preceding week.</p>
<p>In the week ahead, market players will focus on the release of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's prospective plantings report on Tuesday, March 31.</p>
<p>The agency will also produce data on crop progress and weekly export sales figures.</p>
<p>Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, government figures show. Wheat was fourth, behind hay.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- China, the world’s largest <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34fc4c531c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span> buyer, has put purchases of American supplies on hold after the trade war between Washington and Beijing escalated, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>State-grain buyers haven’t received any further orders to continue with the so-called goodwill buying and don’t expect that to happen given the lack of agreement in trade negotiations, said the people, who asked not to be named because the information is private. Still, China currently has no plans to cancel previous purchases of American soybeans, the people said.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump escalated his trade war with China earlier this month, ramping up tariffs on about $200 billion of Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to retaliate with further tariffs of its own. Trump and his counterpart Xi Jinping are expected to meet again at the end of June for the G-20 summit, when some analysts predict a potential resolution.</p>
<p>Government data indicates China bought about 13 million metric tons of American soybeans after the countries agreed to a truce in December, in a move that showed goodwill toward getting the trade dispute resolved. While U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in February that China had pledged to buy an additional 10 million tons of American soy, purchases have now stopped.</p>
<p>Data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture show that China is yet to take delivery of about 7 million tons of U.S. soybeans that it has committed to buy in the current marketing year.</p>
<p>Spokesmen for state-run buyers Cofco and Sinograin didn’t have any immediate comment.</p>

<p>In retaliation for U.S. tariffs levied on Chinese goods during the first round of trade hostilities in 2018, the Asian nation took its business elsewhere, importing the commodity—a key component of the national diet—from Brazil. However, with the South American supply thinning, China is now forced to resume importing soybeans from the U.S.</p>
<p>The technical chart clearly shows soybeans' transition from a depressed market into one that's about to break out.</p>

<p>Soybean futures broke to the topside of a falling wedge, bullish after a $130.50, or 16.20% rise in the two months between the low of May 13 and the high of July 15. The pattern dynamics resemble that of another continuation pattern, a flag or pennant.</p>
<p>The downward bias is presumed to be led by profit takers, and the upside breakout suggests that all supply is spent while demand hungers for more, forcing them to increase bids to seek out willing sellers at higher prices. This signals to market participants that the previous sharp rise is about to reoccur.</p>
<p>Moreover, if the upside breakout will take on the July 15 high of $936.38, the price would complete a much larger, much more serious—bottom—pattern.</p>

<p>For over a year now, the price has been moving mostly sideways. An upside breakout of the July high would complete a bottom, threatening an upside breakout of a falling channel in place since June 2016, just before the UK Brexit vote. An upside breakout of that pattern would challenge the long-term downtrend since September 2012, from the height of just under $1,800.</p>

<p>The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/us-dollar-index"" id=""5fc34518dbf14"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8827"">dollar index</a></span> plunged to three-week lows of 94.77 on Wednesday, before rebounding to trade at 99.04 early on Thursday.</p>
<p>The dollar's losses came after the Federal Reserve dropped a reference to being ""patient"" on the timing of rate hikes, but added that the change in its forward guidance did not mean it has decided on the timing for an initial rate increase.<br> <br>A weaker dollar increases the appeal of U.S. crops to overseas buyers and makes commodities more attractive as an alternative investment, while a stronger dollar weighs on the competitiveness of U.S. supplies on the export market.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc34518dc351"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">US wheat</a></span> for May delivery touched a session high of $5.2000 a bushel, the most since February 20, before trading at $5.1338 during U.S. morning hours, up 2.38 cents, or 0.46%.</p>
<p>A day earlier, the May wheat contract rose 7.2 cents, or 1.44%, to close at $5.1060 as concerns over the health of the winter-wheat crop supported prices.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Kansas winter wheat was rated 41% good to excellent, down from 46% in the previous week, while Oklahoma winter wheat was rated 40% good to excellent, compared to 42% in the previous week.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34518dc47f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">US soybeans</a></span> for May delivery inched up 5.53 cents, or 0.57%, to trade at $9.7113 a bushel after hitting an intraday peak of $9.8020.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the May soybean contract hit $9.5340, a level not seen since October 21, before turning higher to settle at $9.6500, up 10.4 cents, or 1.1%.</p>
<p>Optimism over the outlook for supplies in Brazil and Argentina combined with indications over a slowdown in demand for U.S. soybeans drove down prices.</p>
<p>Brazil and Argentina are major soybean exporters and compete with the U.S. for business on the global market. Large South American crop prospects could weigh on demand for U.S. supplies.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the Chicago Board of Trade, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc34518dc5bd"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">US corn</a></span> for May delivery tacked on 2.52 cents, or 0.67%, to trade at $3.7713 a bushel. US corn for May delivery hit $3.6700 on Wednesday, the lowest level since January 30, before settling at $3.7460, up 3.6 cents, or 1.01%.</p>
<p>Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, government figures show. Wheat was fourth, behind hay.</p>

<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc34a8f49d61"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">CRUDE OIL</a></span></strong> prices fell for the first time in four days yesterday despite the announcement of the first steps in a trade deal at the end of last week, which would have lifted hopes for global growth. Customs data from China showed its crude oil imports for September were 2.2% lower than a month earlier at 41.2 million tons.</p>
<p>Russia’s energy minister Alexander Novak was in Jeddah yesterday to sign a long-term charter with OPEC. He commented that it was important that OPEC+ can react quickly to market changes. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia said that all damages from the September 14 attacks had been repaired and that production was back to pre-attack levels at 9.9 million barrels per day (bpd). The number of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/u.s.-baker-hughes-oil-rig-count-1652"" id=""5fc34a8f4b0e0"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1652"">U.S. rigs</a></span> producing oil rose for the first time in eight weeks, hitting 712 as at last Friday.</p>
<p>Speculative accounts trimmed net long positions for a fourth straight week in the week to October 8, the latest data from CFTC show. Net longs are now the lowest since the week of June 11.</p>
<p>West Texas Intermediate (WTI) remains capped by the 55- and 100-day moving averages at $55.40 and $55.73 respectively. The 100-day average has capped prices on a closing basis since September 24.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/natural-gas"" id=""5fc34a8f4a0a6"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8862"">NATURAL GAS</a></span></strong> is in the process of staging a recovery from the seven-week lows struck last Friday amid forecasts for colder weather across the U.S. in the October 19-23 period. Prices have risen for the past three days and are edging toward the 55- and 100-day moving averages at 2.3229 and 2.3281, respectively.</p>
<p>China’s headline <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/imports-867"" id=""5fc34a8f4b68c"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""867"">imports</a></span> for September showed a sharp deterioration but imports of natural gas were 8.2 million tons, bringing the year-to-date total to 71.2 million tons, a 10% increase from the previous year. Last week’s inventory data to October 4 showed a smaller total of 98 billion cubic feet (bcf) compared with 112 bcf the previous week. That’s still above the 5-year average of 89 bcf.</p>
<h2><strong>Precious metals</strong></h2><p></p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc34a8f4a1c3"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">GOLD</a></span></strong> is holding steady after a two-day decline at the end of last week as U.S. President Trump announced a “mini” trade deal with China dubbed Phase 1. The deal is seen as a major breakthrough and paves the way for a partial trade deal, though China have been quick to state that a lot of work still needs to be done. The improvement in sentiment took its toll on gold and the Thursday/Friday losses tipped the precious metal into negative for the week. It’s still trading within the downward-sloping channel mentioned last week, with the outer limits now approximately at 1,447 and 1,513.</p>
<p>Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) added to gold holdings for a 20th session, Bloomberg reported yesterday. That’s the longest buying streak in a decade.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/silver"" id=""5fc34a8f4a2d3"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8836"">SILVER</a></span></strong> has fared a tad better than gold, rallying for the past three days with exchange-traded funds adding to their existing holdings for the past six sessions, according to Bloomberg reports, bringing total net purchases for 2019 to 108 million ounces. Speculative investors had also been net bullish at the last reporting date on October 8, turning net buyers for the first time in five weeks, according to CFTC data.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/platinum"" id=""5fc34a8f4a3d7"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8910"">PLATINUM</a></span></strong> continues its retreat from two-week highs as the metal struggles to sustain a move above the 55-day moving average attempted on Thursday. That moving average is now at 898.65 with platinum currently trading at 894.48.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/palladium"" id=""5fc34a8f4a4de"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8883"">PALLADIUM</a></span></strong> reached a new record high yesterday as the implications for some sort of trade deal boosted the metal. The assumption is that a deal would improve the prospects for global growth, which in turn would increase demand for cars and hence boost demand for the metal in pollution control devices in those cars.</p>
<p>Speculative investors were well positioned for the latest record-breaking rally, having increased net long positions for the past six weeks, lifting net longs to the highest in more than seven months.</p><div class=""outerEleWrapper"">

<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/copper"" id=""5fc34a8f4a5db"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8831"">COPPER</a></span></strong>’s rally after the mini trade deal announcement is currently stalling at the 100-day moving average at 2.6293. That moving average has held on a closing basis since September 13.</p>
<p>China’s headline import and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/exports-595"" id=""5fc34a8f4bbc4"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""595"">export</a></span> data for September were dismal, with a three-year equaling low 8.5% contraction. However, copper imports were a bright spot in the report, rising to the highest this year at 445,000 tons, but still down 15% from a year earlier. Copper stocks at warehouses monitored by the London Metal Exchange (LME) were higher for a second straight week, the first time this has happened since July.</p>
<p>Speculative investors remain a bit skeptical about the industrial metal’s rise, having increased net short positions for a third straight week, according to the latest report to October 8 from CFTC. Net shorts are now at a five-week high.</p>
<h2><strong>Agriculturals</strong></h2><p>U.S. President Trump said that China has agreed to increase purchases of U.S. agricultural products to $40-$50 billion annually under the “Phase 1” trade agreement. This compares with the 2017 U.S. exports total of $19.5 billion.</p>
<p>It was inevitable therefore that agricultural commodities rose, with <strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34a8f4a6d8"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">SOYBEANS</a></span></strong> an outperformer. The commodity hit a 16-month high of 9.38 yesterday, having risen for seven consecutive days. Soybeans were given an additional boost from the recent World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture on Friday, which pegged U.S. soybean supply lower than expected.</p>
<p>Speculative investors were already bullish on the commodity prior to the latest surge, having boosted net long positions for a fourth straight week to hit the highest since June 2018.</p><div class=""outerEleWrapper"">

The rally hit the 100-day moving average at 3.9568 but failed to trade above it. That moving average has capped prices for nine weeks. Speculative investors trimmed net short positions for a second straight week, reducing them to the lowest since September 3.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-sugar-no11"" id=""5fc34a8f4a8f1"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8869"">SUGAR</a></span></strong> is consolidating gains made since the beginning of September as the market faces a supply shortage for this season. The International Sugar Organisation (ISO) has pegged the 2019/20 season deficit at nearly five million tons, which is helping to support prices. However, the shortfall comes after two straight years of surpluses and the ISO reckons there is still a 95 million ton backlog to clear.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc34a8f4a9e3"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">WHEAT</a></span></strong> prices touched a near three-month high yesterday following last week’s trade deal framework. Prices have stalled near the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the drop from June 27 to September 3 at 5.109 and could be facing their first down-day in three today.</p>
<p>Speculative investors turned net sellers of the commodity for the first time in five weeks, according to data as at October 8 from CFTC. Net shorts are now at the highest since early-June.</p>

<li>Food demand continues to grow</li>
<li>Three reasons why 2021 could be a bullish year for grain and oilseed prices</li>
</ul><p>The beginning of September means that the 2020 harvest season in the US and countries in the northern hemisphere is on the immediate horizon. Grains and oilseeds are the agricultural products that feed the world. All signs are that there will be ample supplies to meet all requirements over the coming months.</p>
<p>Each year is always a new adventure when it comes to agricultural commodity output. Mother Nature determines the weather, so she's responsible for the size of crops. The US is the world’s leading producer and exporter of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc34d4004c5c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">corn</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34d4004f09"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span>, and a leading producer of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc34d4004fed"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">wheat</a></span>. Consumption is ubiquitous as all people worldwide require nutrition.</p>
<p>It has been eight years since a weather event caused corn, soybean, and wheat prices to soar. The 2012 drought sent corn and bean futures to all-time highs, and wheat rose to its highest price since the 2008 global drought. Since 2012, the world has added around 640 million more mouths to feed. The demand side of the fundamental equation for agricultural products is an ever-growing factor. Meanwhile, supply can be as fickle as the weather.</p><h2><strong>Late-season rally in soybeans, corn, and wheat</strong></h2><p>Grain and oilseed futures prices often experience rallies and increased price volatility during the spring planting and summer growing seasons because of the weather’s uncertainty and its impact on annual supplies. In 2020, the futures markets experienced late-season rallies beginning in mid-August.</p>

<p>The daily chart of new-crop November soybeans highlights the rally from $8.6525 on August 10 to the most recent high of $9.6950 on September 4, a rise of 12% in under one month. The November beans were trading at the $9.69 level at the end of last week at the high. </p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img title=""Corn Daily"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picdb4f34f9309c110720cbe73157c5ceef.png"" alt=""Corn Daily""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Corn Daily</span></div></div></div><em>&nbsp;</em><p></p>
<p>New-crop December corn futures rose from $3.20 per bushel on August 12 to a high of $3.6425 on August 31 or 13.8%. The December futures were just below the $3.58 level on Friday, September 4.</p>

<p>December CBOT wheat futures rose from $4.97 on August 12 to $5.6850 on September 1 or 14.4%. The wheat futures were just over the $5.50 per bushel level at the end of last week.</p><h2><strong>August 10 derecho: a reminder of the fragile state of supplies</strong></h2><p>The US Department of Agriculture’s August World Agricultural Supply and Demand report was not all that bullish for grain and oilseed futures prices. It said supplies of the agricultural products will be ample in the 2020 crop year and sufficient to meet worldwide requirements.</p>
<p>However, two days before the USDA report, a derecho or violent winds and rainstorms swept across the fertile plains of the United States, causing some damage to crops. The weather event was a reminder that annual supplies of the products that feed the world are as fickle as the weather each year.</p>
<p>Mother Nature has cooperated with the agriculture markets in the US over the past eight years, but that is no guarantee for the future. The derecho was a wakeup call for consumers that abundant grain and oilseed supplies are a function of supportive weather conditions. The supply side of the fundamental equation in agricultural commodities is a year-to-year affair and can be highly variable.</p><h2><strong>Food demand continues to grow</strong></h2><p>Meanwhile, the demand side of the equation is an ever-growing factor for the products that feed the world. Each quarter, the worldwide population increases by about 20 million people. At the turn of this century, there were approximately six billion mouths to feed on our planet.</p>
<p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img title=""US and World Population Clock"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picf200def19244fe19e77be00c956f34ba.png"" alt=""US and World Population Clock""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">US and World Population Clock</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p><em>Source: US Census Bureau</em></p>
<p>As the chart above shows, at the end of last week, that number stood at over 7.678 billion, almost 28% higher over the past two decades. The exponential population growth rate means that more people require more nutritional products each day.</p>
<p>The supply side of the equation for food needs to keep pace with the ever-rising demand. Therefore, the variability of supplies because of the weather could cause periods of extreme volatility in the grain and oilseed futures markets over the coming years if supplies become scarce.</p><h2><strong>Three reasons why 2021 could be a bullish year for grain and oilseed prices</strong></h2><p>The first reason for a bullish outlook in the agricultural markets in 2021 is demographics. The fundamental equation tells us that supply volatility and steadily increasing demand is a cocktail for significant price swings. Corn, soybean, and wheat prices are significantly lower than in 2012. A weather event could cause explosive rallies in the futures market. Since 2012, the global population and demand side of the equation has grown by 640 million people.</p>
<p>The second reason is the recent trend in the US dollar. The dollar is the pricing mechanism for most commodities, and the grain and oilseed markets are no exception. A falling dollar tends to push commodity prices higher.</p>

A falling dollar is bullish for corn, soybean, and wheat prices.</p>
<p>Finally, in late August, the US Federal Reserve told markets they are <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/analysis/fed-bids-goodbye-to-phillips-curve-and-preemptive-interest-rate-hikes-200535780"" id=""5fc34d400625f"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""pal"" data-articleid=""200535780"">willing to tolerate</a></span> higher inflation levels over the coming months and years. The 2% target became more of an average, with members of the Fed saying that since inflation has remained below the target for so long, they would be willing to see it above the target before raising short-term rates. Rising inflation, the unprecedented level of central bank liquidity, and government stimulus programs are all highly inflationary. Higher inflation is extremely supportive of rising commodity prices.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mother Nature holds the key to the agricultural markets. While the prices of corn, beans, and wheat are likely to move higher because of economic factors, a weather event in 2021 has the potential to ignite rallies that could take prices to new all-time highs given the ever-growing demand side of this fundamental equation.</p>

        <p>Investing.com - U.S. corn futures fell for the sixth consecutive session on Monday to trade near the lowest level in more than five months amid indications of rapid planting progress in the U.S. Midwest last week.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc345e31107d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">US corn</a></span> for July delivery hit a session low of $3.6720 a bushel, before trading at $3.6813 during U.S. morning hours, down 1.07 cents, or 0.29%.</p>
<p>On Friday, the front-month May corn contract fell to $3.6360, a level not seen since November 20, before closing at $3.6440, down 6.2 cents, or 1.69%.</p>
<p>Corn prices lost 15.13 cents, or 3.95%, last week, the biggest weekly decline in 12 weeks, as forecasts for drier weather across the Midwest was expected to further aid planting of the crop.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, approximately 9% of the corn crop was planted as of April 19, up from just 2% in the preceding week and above the 6% planted during the same week a year earlier.</p>
<p>Later in the day, the USDA will release updated crop progress numbers for the week ended April 26.</p>

<p>Wheat futures dropped 7.5 cents, or 1.37%, last week, the third straight weekly loss, as dry weather conditions in key U.S. wheat-growing states was expected to benefit crop conditions.</p>
<p>The USDA said that the U.S. winter wheat crop was rated 42% good to excellent as of last week. Approximately 34% of the crop was in good to excellent condition in the same week a year earlier.</p>
<p>The agency also said that 36% of the spring wheat crop was planted as of last week, up from 17% in the preceding week. Only 9% of the crop was planted in the same week a year earlier, while the five-year average for this time of year is 19%.</p>

<p>Large South American crop prospects could weigh on demand for U.S. supplies.</p>

Corn prices in 2017 declined for the fifth straight year and record-large U.S. stocks pushed growers to look for potentially higher-value alternatives.</p> <p>However, as acres devoted to varieties such as white corn, organic and non-genetically modified corn continue to rise, the benefits have shrunk for farmers switching to such strains.</p> <p>White corn is used by companies such as the PepsiCo Inc (O:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/pepsico"" id=""5fc3568f74bb6"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8358"">PEP</a></span>) unit Frito-Lay to make corn chips, and by tortilla and chip makers including Chicago-based Azteca Foods.

        <p>Investing.com - U.S. soybean futures fell for the fourth consecutive session on Thursday to trade at a three-week low as concerns over Brazilian export prospects eased.</p>
<p>A broadly stronger U.S. dollar also weighed. The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/us-dollar-index"" id=""5fc344cb637ae"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8827"">U.S. dollar index</a></span>, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.25% to 96.22, the highest level since September 2003.</p>
<p>A stronger dollar reduces the appeal of U.S. crops to overseas buyers and makes commodities less attractive as an alternative investment.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc344cb63acd"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">US soybeans</a></span> for May delivery touched a daily low of $9.9113 a bushel, a level not seen since February 13, before trading at $9.9340 during U.S. morning hours, down 0.4 cents, or 0.05%.</p>
<p>A day earlier, soybean prices lost 18.2 cents, or 1.8%, to end at $9.9400 a bushel as a two-week strike by Brazilian truck drivers appeared to be coming to an end.</p>
<p>Brazilian police said there were only four protests affecting federal highways on Wednesday, down from seven on Tuesday and well below peaks of more than 100 a week ago.</p>
<p>Brazil is a major soybean exporter and competes with the U.S. for business on the global market, which could weigh on demand for U.S. supplies.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc344cb63bce"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">US wheat</a></span> for May delivery dropped 1.02 cents, or 0.21%, to trade at $4.9438 a bushel after hitting an intraday low of $4.9113, the weakest level since February 26.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the May wheat contract tumbled 10.0 cents, or 1.98%, to close at $4.9600 a bushel amid ample global supplies and indications of reduced demand for U.S. wheat.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the Chicago Board of Trade, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc344cb63cc3"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">US corn</a></span> for May delivery inched down 0.6 cents, or 0.19%, to trade at $3.8860 a bushel. US corn for May delivery shed 1.4 cents, or 0.38%, on Wednesday to settle at $3.8940.</p>
<p>Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, government figures show. Wheat was fourth, behind hay.</p>

Tired Soybean Traders Ask As Trump Delays Trade Deal — Again,https://www.investing.com/analysis/whats-new-tired-soybean-traders-ask-as-trump-delays-trade-deal--again-200489809,"By Investing.com (Barani Krishnan/Investing.com)CommoditiesDec 04, 2019 11:00AM ET","<p></p><p>To soybean traders—and perhaps planters too—Donald Trump might as well have said that 50 billion pies will fall out of the sky for them each year.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>Since the U.S. president promised in October that China will buy $50 billion or more of farm products from the United States a year under the phase one of their trade agreement, grain markets’ belief in an imminent deal has turned from hope to prayer and, finally, despair.</p><p></p>
<p>So, when Trump announced on Tuesday that a pact with China will likely come after 2020—to deprive Beijing of any advantage it may have in pressuring him for a settlement in its favor before next November’s U.S. presidential election—there was an almost discernible yawn from the agricultural trading community.</p><!--start-image-->

<!--end-image--><p>The U.S. soybeans market—poised to be the biggest beneficiary of any China deal—surprisingly closed in the positive, after 10 days in the red, suggesting relief that the trade ballyhoo was finally over and the market could go back to focusing on some “real” fundamentals. </p>
<p>“The trade war rumbles are front and center, but thankfully grain markets appear to be looking beyond that news,” said Dan Hueber, founder of The Hueber Report, a St. Charles, Illinois-based agricultural risk consultancy. </p>
<p></p><p>Hueber noted that the delayed China deal wasn’t the only bad news in commodity markets on Tuesday. Less than 24 hours earlier, the Trump administration had also announced tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports from Brazil and Argentina, and threatened up to 100% duties on $2.4 billion of French cheese, champagne and other products.</p><p></p>
<p>Soybeans aside, U.S. corn prices also fell modestly on Tuesday. Only wheat got crushed but that was probably due to the fact it had been overbought recently on fears of tight supply, said traders.</p>
<p>Added Hueber: </p>
<p></p><blockquote>“I suspect tariff fatigue is becoming more and more ingrained within the psyche of the trade.” </blockquote><p></p>
<p>On the contrary, equity markets were more “unsettled” by Trump’s China announcement, Hueber noted, with stocks on Wall Street suffering their biggest daily loss in two months.</p>
<p>So, where would U.S. soybeans trade fundamentally if big buyer China is out of the equation—a prospect looking increasingly likely after Dec .15, when the Trump administration and government of President Xi Jinping exchange even more punitive tariffs?</p>
<p>According to Investing.com’s Daily Technical Outlook, Chicago-traded <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34b7694bf0"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybean futures</a></span> for January delivery remain in a “Strong Sell” position. Yet, there’s potential for the contract to test $8.8336 per bushel in a rebound, versus Tuesday’s settlement of $8.7275.</p>
<p>Said Jack Scoville, who heads grains analysis at Chicago brokerage Price Futures Group:</p>
<p></p><blockquote>“The U.S. harvest is entering its final stages now and many producers are putting their soybeans into storage and not selling. This has caused basis levels for soy to firm in the country and at the Gulf of Mexico.”</blockquote><p></p>
<p>Scoville concurs with Hueber that the market “is tired of hearing about the potential U.S.-China trade deal, and wants to see the real thing.” </p>
<p>In the case of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc34b7694f59"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">corn futures</a></span>, Investing.com’s Daily Technical Outlook holds a “Strong Buy” recommendation for the March contract, forecasting a top-end resistance of $3.8820 per bushel versus Tuesday’s settlement of $3.8150.</p>
<p>“While March corn hasn’t broken through key resistance, it continues to flirt with resistance around the $3.83 mark,” said Hueber.</p>
<p></p><blockquote>“Indicators have turned higher, and we may close above the 21-day moving average. The path of least resistance should be transitioning to the upside.”</blockquote><p></p>
<p>For March <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc34b769507a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">wheat futures</a></span>, Investing.com’s recommendation is “Neutral”, with top-end resistance at $5.5294 per bushel and firmest support at $5.0272. Tuesday’s close was $5.2538.</p>
<p>Said Scoville: </p>
<p></p><blockquote>“World wheat prices will still be dictated by what happens in Europe and the Black Sea area, and U.S. prices will most likely remain a follower as the U.S. tries to compete for sales. Chart patterns on daily and weekly charts imply more up pressure on prices this week though.”</blockquote><p></p>
<p>Crop fundamentals aside, fund alignment in grains could also turn positive, pushing prices higher. </p>
<p>Added Hueber:</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
<p>“It would come as no surprise to anyone watching the soybean market as of late that speculative funds have been sellers, and as it turned out, they sold a record quantity.""</p>
</blockquote><p></p>
<p></p><blockquote>
<p>“While I would not suggest the boat is ready to tip, it is undoubtedly beginning to list to one side.”</p>
</blockquote><p></p>

Below is a quick overview.</li><p></p>
<p></p><li>We put a 60% probability of an interim trade deal, which should help to de-escalate the trade war. However, the road to a big deal is still paved with many obstacles in our view.</li><p></p>
<p></p><li>An interim deal should be positive for risk sentiment in the short term. </li><p></p>
<p><strong>Who will meet?</strong></p>
<p>A US delegation led by US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and US Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin will meet for the 13th round of high-level negotiations with their Chinese counterpart in the trade war. The Chinese delegation will be led by Vice - Premier Liu He, Xi Jinp ing’s right-hand man when it comes to economics and financial issues. The vice-premier is expected to be joined by other top officials, among others the Commerce Minister Zhong Shan, who became part of the core of the Chinese negotiation team after the break-down in May. He was generally seen as a hawkish addition to the trade team. Last y ear during the trade war he said that the US “don’t know the history and culture of China” and “The US should not underestimate China’s resolve and will”.</p>
<p><strong>What are the odds of an interim deal?</strong></p>
<p>We see a more than 50-50 chance that the talks end with a small interim deal, as both sides seem to have an interest in striking such a deal (we put the probability at 60%).</p>
<p>On the US side, there is a rising concern over the weakening of the US economy heading into the Presidential election year in 2020. This week US <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/ism-manufacturing-pmi-173"" id=""5fc34a50de2cf"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""173"">ISM manufacturing</a></span> showed another sharp drop in activity with export orders being particularly weak (see chart). Politico wrote in Sep tember that Trump ’s advisers are looking for an escap e hatch out of the tariff hikes Trump has coming in mid-October and in December (see table). With limited ways to boost the economy through fiscal policy and monetary policy in the hands of the Fed, the White House has few tools to keep the economy strong next year. Tariff hikes would work as a further drag and increasingly hurt the one pillar that is holding up the economy, the US consumer. M aking a deal with China allowing Trump to pull back the tariff hikes and even get something in return from China looks to be a favourable outcome.</p>
<p>It comes with a price, though: Trump reduces the pressure on China by taking tariff hikes off the table, something he may not like. But he still might favour it over a further weakening of the economy.</p>
<p>On the Chinese side, there has been concern over Trump’s temper and if he could in effect escalate tensions (which it looked like in early August when he retaliated in response to China’s retaliation). To show goodwill by buying US agriculture again could work to calm Trump down and reduce the risk of another bout of escalation. China has already bought a considerable amount of US <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34a50ddd0d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soy beans</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/lean-hogs"" id=""5fc34a50de071"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8913"">pork</a></span> ahead of the trade talks according to the Ministry of Commerce in China. There is no doubt that agriculture is one of the strongest cards China is holding in the trade war. Many US farmers are hurting badly from China halting their purchases, and flooding in some areas this year has only added to the pain. Listening to interviews with farmers, they generally support Trump standing up to China, but the pain is growing and many express impatience with the deal. On top of the short-term pain, there is a growing concern that farmers will never get back their strongest growth market, which they have worked on for many years to build up.</p>
<p><strong>What would an interim deal look like?</strong></p>
<p>As suggested above, the cornerstone of an interim deal would be China buying US agriculture again. In exchange, Trump would, as a minimum, have to postpone the announced tariff increases on 15 October and 15 December. The question, though, is how much China would buy and how much they will demand in return. This is why it may not be all smooth sailing. China would be reluctant to completely return to full-scale purchases and give away their strongest card unless they got some serious concessions in return. A compromise could be (unofficially) that China buys for a certain period of time and a continuation of purchases would be conditioned on a further roll-back of tariff rates. It easily gets a bit speculative, as we don’t know exactly what is on the table. But agriculture and tariff relief is likely to be part of an interim deal in some way.</p>
<p>Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) have also been mentioned as a possible ingredient in a deal. If so that would be positive, as it is where the two sides have struggled. We believe China is of the view that they have already done enough to tighten protection of IPR through a law earlier this year, that, among other things, increases punishments for infringement of IPR significantly. Trump could choose to be satisfied with this and write it into the deal and take the credit for it.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: An interim deal to underpin risk assets in the short term</strong></p>
<p>We expect an interim deal to underpin risk assets in the short term. An interim deal would to some extent be a sign that Trump has a fairly low pain threshold and reduce the tail risk of a much further escalation. What happens on the other side of an interim deal will depend on whether the new ‘ceasefire’ stay s longer than a month this time and whether the two sides move any closer to a real deal. We believe the latter is much more difficult as China is, in our view, unlikely to give many inches from where it ended in early May. They had to backtrack because of internal resistance in China to the deal that was on the table. That resistance will not go away because the deal was seen as a breach of Chinese sovereignty and triggered reminders of the ‘unequal treaties’ following the Opium wars in the 19th century. The US side, on the other hand, will struggle to settle for a smaller deal than what they had in sight before the talks broke down. In our view this deadlock will be very difficult to break.</p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

Soy As China Stops U.S. Farm Buying,https://www.investing.com/analysis/more-distress-for-corn-vs-soy-as-china-stops-us-farm-buying-200454468,"By Investing.com (Barani Krishnan/Investing.com)CommoditiesAug 13, 2019 06:25AM ET","<p>The party seems over for now for U.S. corn bulls, though soybean longs remain hopeful after a friendly government crop report, as farmers across the country wallow in misery from China’s decision not to buy from them.</p>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc3498806150"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">U.S. corn futures</a></span>’ front-month contract, September, fell 2% in Tuesday’s Asian trading, extending its 6% tumble—which marked the limit-down move—on the Chicago Board of Trade on Monday, pressured by higher-than-expected yield and acreage numbers cited by the government.</p>
<p>Before the summer, there couldn’t have been a better upward trending grain for speculators as corn rallied 20% in May alone—its best month in seven years—from a plantings squeeze brought on by inclement weather and flooding.</p>
<p>China is not a top destination for U.S. soybeans. Yet, in March, Chinese importers booked their largest U.S. corn purchase in at least 5-1/2 years, a rare sale of the grain in the middle of the U.S.-China trade war. Data at that time showed that private exporters sold 300,000 tonnes of corn to Chinese destinations for the 2018/19 marketing year, which ends on Aug. 31.</p>
<p></p><h2><strong>In The Red Since June, Corn Is Now A ‘Strong Sell’</strong></h2><p></p><div class=""outerEleWrapper"">
	<div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic0576f02bd531bcb42297576328688fe3.png"" alt=""US Corn 300 Minute Chart"" title=""US Corn 300 Minute Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">US Corn 300 Minute Chart</span></div></div></div>

	</div>
</div><p>But after hitting its highest price since summer 2016, in May, U.S. corn’s front-month contract turned south the past two months—falling 1.6% in June and 4.8% in July. Month-to-date for August, it is down 5.8%.</p>
<p>The immediate future for corn bulls could be more distressing, based on technical outlooks for the grain and China’s suspension of U.S. farm imports.</p>
<p>Investing.com’s Daily Technical Outlook has a “Strong Sell” recommendation on corn, projecting a base case support of $3.7696 per bushel. Based on Monday’s settlement of $3.8525, that’s a drop of another 8.29 cents, or 2.2%.</p>
<p>Michael Seery, who plots technical outlooks at his Seery Futures consultancy in Plainfield, Illinois, said even fundamentally, corn “has absolutely nothing going for it, as demand is extremely weak.”</p>
<p>U.S. farmers lost their fourth largest export market after China officially cancelled all purchases of U.S. agricultural products, a retaliatory move following President Donald Trump’s pledge to slap 10% tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese imports.</p>
<p>China’s exit piles on to a devastating year for farmers, who’ve struggled through record flooding and droughts that destroyed crop yields, and trade war escalations that have lowered prices and profits this year, CNBC reported.</p>
<p>Bob Kuylen, a farmer of 35 years in North Dakota, told the network:</p>
<p></p><blockquote>“It’s really, really getting bad out here. There’s no incentive to keep farming, except that I’ve invested everything I have in it, and it’s hard to walk away.”</blockquote><p></p>
<p></p><h3><strong>Demand Is Down, But Corn Yields Surprisingly Up</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Adding to the China-induced pains was the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which surprised corn traders on Monday with a much higher yield than expected at 169.5 bushels per acre. Acreage was also higher than forecast, at 90 million acres.The USDA pegged corn production at 13.9 billion bushels. Coupled with 125 million fewer bushels of demand, coming mostly from a cut in exports, ending stocks stood at 2.181 billion bushels. The conclusion was a crop in excess supply of 171 million bushels since July and and 561 million above total market expectation.Jeff Kaprelian of the Hueber Report in St Charles, Illinois, described the USDA report as “one of those reports we’ll talk about for years to come”.But he also said the outlook for corn could improve over time, though not right away.Said Kaprelian:</p>
<blockquote>“I personally have a hard time believing this market will stay down for very long given the enhanced potential for an early freeze coupled with the lateness of the crop. Ten percent of the crop still hasn’t pollinated, according to the crop progress report.”</blockquote>
<p>Indigo Ag Inc., a Boston-based crop intelligence firm, seemed to agree, saying on Monday:</p>
<blockquote>“Significant uncertainty remains before crops reach maturity. Of particular concern is dry weather, which will be especially harmful to crops with shallow rooting, and the risk of an early freeze for late-planted crops.""</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Soybeans A ‘Buy’ Despite China; Outlook Neutral To Friendly</strong></h3><p></p>
<p>Compared to corn, the crop outlook for soybeans was neutral to friendly, with yield unchanged at 48.5 bushels per acre and acreage unexpectedly cut to 76.7 million acres, versus forecasts for 81 million. Production was 120 million bushels lower than expectations, at 1.07 billion bushels. Final stocks were at 755 million bushels; 66 million less than forecast.</p>
<p>Despite U.S. soybean farmers missing out on China as their No. 1 export destination now, the improved crop outlook has limited the market’s downside.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- The brewing trade war between China and the U.S. is claiming commodity markets as one of its first victims.</p>
<p>The Bloomberg Commodities Index, a measure of 26 raw materials, lost 3 percent this week, the most since February. The losses stand out in a week when other risk assets, like emerging-market stocks, were in the green.</p>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34f6c2ba7d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">Soybeans</a></span> have been hardest hit, with pricing falling to the lowest in a decade as China’s duties on U.S. supplies took effect. Metal and energy markets were also caught by fears that the trade spat will set off a global economic slowdown. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/copper"" id=""5fc34f6c2bd5b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8831"">Copper prices</a></span> sank to a one-year low and oil is on track for the worst week in five months.</p>
<p>China, the biggest consumer of everything from copper to <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/coal-cme-futures"" id=""5fc34f6c2be3e"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""961733"">coal</a></span>, has warned the proliferation of tariffs could cause a global recession.</p>
<p>""We have so many shorts in the market that there is a real possibility of a squeeze occurring next week,” said Oliver Nugent, a commodities strategist at ING Bank NV.</p>
<p>He said the trade dispute, and ensuing losses in commodities, are likely to remain until after the U.S. midterm elections in November. “We don’t think Trump necessarily has the incentive to dial back,” he said.</p>
<p>Traders are also closely studying data from China for evidence of a slowdown. On Friday, reports showed weaker-than-expected growth in imports, and indicators of investment, factory output and retail sales growth all slowed in May.</p>
<p>""<span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/news/economic-indicators/chinas-june-exports-jump-surplus-with-us-at-record-high-1528391"" id=""5fc34f6c2ca65"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""oal"" data-articleid=""1528391"">Chinese import data</a></span> wasn’t particularly positive, so there are all these concerns about the second half,"" said Alastair Munro, an analyst at Marex Spectron. “If the trade tariff war continues to escalate, then obviously it’s not going to help.”</p>
<p>The main market movers include:</p>
<p>Copper</p>
<p>Often regarded as an economic bellwether, the metal has taken a beating in the past month. Since June 7, prices have tumbled 16 percent, marking one of the fastest and deepest selloffs in years.</p>
<p>Traders will be watching today’s U.S. commitment of traders report for signs that speculators are continuing to cut their positions. Last week, the net-long position was the least bullish in three months.</p>
<p>Oil</p>
<p>Futures in New York plunged 5 percent to $70.07 a barrel this week. Short-term bearish signals for oil prices on the supply side include Libya restarting a key oil field that had been shut since February, tempering the International Energy Agency’s warning that spare capacity may be stretched to the limit.</p>
<p>Soybeans</p>
<p>Soybean prices lost 5.9 percent this week. China’s imports of the oilseed are likely to decline for the first time in 15 years.</p>
<p>Mining stocks</p>
<p>The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/mining"" id=""5fc34f6c2bf20"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""12507"">FTSE 350 Mining index</a></span> slumped for a fifth week. <span itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Corporation""><span itemprop=""name""> Glencore </span></span> Plc (LON:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/glencore"" id=""5fc34f6c2bff3"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""13811"">GLEN</a></span>),  the world’s biggest commodities trader, lost 4.9 percent.</p>

    </div>
        <p>(Bloomberg) -- After taking a knock last year, raw materials had a mixed first half, with a gauge of spot prices climbing about 7% even as the U.S.-China trade war rumbled on and macro-economic data pointed to a slowdown. Crude rose as OPEC and Russia pressed on with output curbs, iron ore took off after a supply hit, and gold had an upswing. Bad weather has roiled major crops.</p>
<p>As the second half gets under way in earnest, What to Watch offers a guide to prospects through to the year-end for main commodities including <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc3478fdbaf1"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">oil</a></span>, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gasoline-rbob"" id=""5fc3478fdbf21"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""954867"">gas</a></span>, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc3478fdc07b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">gold</a></span>, iron and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/copper"" id=""5fc3478fdc17e"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8831"">copper</a></span>. Outlooks for <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc3478fdc23d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">wheat</a></span>, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc3478fdc2f9"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">corn</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc3478fdc3c6"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span> are also weighed, plus ship fuel as new rules on lower-sulfur content are set to kick in.</p>
<p>Some of the main drivers in the months to come will carry over from the first half, especially the trade dust-up between Washington and Beijing. That prolonged fight could now bleed into currency policy. Central-bank easing, including potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, will also be a significant theme, and there’ll be key testimony this week from Chairman Jerome Powell. U.S.-Iranian tensions are likely to escalate, too. So what’s in store?</p>
<p>Wild Ride</p>
<p>Oil endured a roller-coaster ride in the first half as investors navigated concerns about demand, the impact of rising U.S. production, tighter sanctions on Iranian exports, and targeted cutbacks by OPEC and allies including Russia. After climbing as high as $75 a barrel in late April, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/brent-oil"" id=""5fc3478fdc4bd"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8833"">Brent</a></span> futures ended June at about $67, up 24%, to post the strongest first-half performance since 2016.</p>
<p>OPEC and its backers agreed on July 2 to prolong the cuts into early 2020, and the extent of compliance will play a major role in crude’s performance over the rest of 2019. Progress in U.S.-China trade talks, if any, may be an even bigger factor, affecting how investors view consumption. But it’s Iran that could be the ultimate wildcard, with the OPEC member threatening to disrupt shipments in the Persian Gulf as the Trump administration tightens sanctions. The median analyst forecast calls for $70-a-barrel Brent in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Sitting Pretty</p>
<p>Gold bulls have plenty to cheer as prices closed the first half near a six-year high. With growth concerns taking center stage, central banks are turning more dovish. Prospects for lower rates and fresh stimulus suggest the rally still has room to run, even as a stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report on Friday took some steam out of the rally. The outlook has aided miners including Barrick Gold Corp. and Newmont Goldcorp Corp. in a rapidly consolidating industry.</p>
<p>Adding to gold’s upswing are trade and geopolitical tensions, which have invigorated demand for havens and fed inflows into bullion-backed exchange-traded funds. Unless there’s a definite resolution to the U.S.-China trade conflict and the complex standoff over Iran, these risks will support further gains. <span itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Corporation""><span itemprop=""name""> Goldman Sachs Group </span></span> Inc (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/goldman-sachs-group"" id=""5fc3478fdc585"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""266"">GS</a></span>). has raised its 12-month forecast to $1,475 an ounce from $1,425. Spot prices were last at about $1,405, up 9.5% this year.</p>
<p>Tough Times</p>
<p>After a strong start to 2019 fueled by expectations for robust demand and tight mine supply, copper has sputtered, barely managing to eke out a gain in the first six months. The metal has slid about 11% from a nine-month high reached in April as concerns over the impact of the U.S.-China trade war and the prospect of slowing global economies deterred investors.</p>
<p>Bulls are counting on resilient demand to bring supply concerns back to the fore. Copper use is expected to top production by 189,000 metric tons this year, according to the International Copper Study Group. Codelco, the world’s largest miner of the metal, said last month Chinese demand remains solid and the recent rout wasn’t justified. Goldman Sachs expects China grid investment, housing completions and potential infrastructure stimulus to help boost prices in six months to $6,700 a ton, 12% higher than at the end of June.</p>
<p>Shocks and Ore</p>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/iron-ore-62-cfr-futures"" id=""5fc3478fdc65e"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""961729"">Iron ore</a></span> was the standout winner among commodities in the first half as benchmark prices soared more than 60% to the highest since 2014. The rally was driven by tighter supplies from Brazil and Australia coupled with roaring Chinese demand, benefiting miners including <span itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Corporation""><span itemprop=""name""> Rio Tinto </span></span> (LON:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/rio-tinto"" id=""5fc3478fdc732"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""6597"">RIO</a></span>) Group and BHP Group. All grades of ore have surged, although spreads have narrowed.</p>
<p>After such a jump, this half may be trickier territory for bulls. Supplies may recover some ground, especially from Brazil, and investors will track port holdings in China for signs the drawdown has run its course. Most market watchers now expect prices to ease. Among them, <span itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Corporation""><span itemprop=""name""> Morgan Stanley </span></span> (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/morgan-stanley"" id=""5fc3478fdc82d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8056"">MS</a></span>) predicts a fall to $90 a ton in the fourth quarter as part of Vale SA’s halted supply restarts, China’s output rises and demand slows. After futures sank on Friday as China’s top steel group said gains were overdone, they’re now rebounding.</p>
<p>Wheat’s Up?</p>
<p>Wheat’s had a tumultuous first half, sinking to a 15-month low in May before a rally in corn helped the grain make up its losses. Crops are now being harvested across many of the major exporters and signs point to bulging bins in the coming months, with Russia forecast to keep its rank as the top shipper.</p>
<p>Still, wheat prices could get a fresh boost if U.S. flooding drags on and hampers the rival corn crop. The two grains vie for use in livestock feed rations, which could give wheat a fresh demand boost if corn supply dwindles. Rabobank Group pegs Chicago wheat futures at $5.35 a bushel in the fourth quarter, slightly higher than current prices.</p>
<p>Rain Pain</p>
<p>For soybeans and corn, the first half was all about disruptions. The U.S.-China trade war lingered over the market. Tariff fears intensified as President Donald Trump’s threats to tax Mexican goods spurred promises of retaliation. But while those tensions eased, the weather kept getting worse for Midwest farmers, with condition ratings for both crops at the lowest since 2012. The relentless rain fired up the corn market, with futures surging 18% in May alone.</p>
<p>Soybeans also got a weather boost, albeit less than corn. With plantings under threat, oilseed prices regained some of their trade-war losses and funds backed away from bearish wagers. The sad state of affairs in U.S. crops will be on display, with the government scheduled to update conditions, release export inspections and deliver a monthly supply and demand report that will predict how the planting woes will affect exports and domestic use. On Thursday, closely held agribusiness giant Cargill Inc. will tell investors how it has been navigating the American spring deluge and trade war with China.</p>
<p>Whither the Weather?</p>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/natural-gas"" id=""5fc3478fdc941"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8862"">Natural gas</a></span> bulls are hoping for a little help from the weather gods after a first half that saw prices crash globally as a flood of liquefied cargoes hit the market. Asia and Europe saw prices plummet about 50%, while they sank more than 20% in the U.S. The main culprit is new plants in Australia and U.S., led by Royal Dutch Shell (LON:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/royal-dutch-shell-a-shr?cid=6593"" id=""5fc3478fdca30"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""6593"">RDSa</a></span>) Plc’s offshore Prelude project, boosting supply faster than demand can catch up. As storage tanks in the top buyers in Asia began to fill, cargoes were re-routed to Europe until it, too, reached glut status.</p>
<p>The oversupply has driven prices so low that the new LNG plants in the U.S. may have to temporarily stop producing this half until winter weather revives demand. If that doesn’t happen, though, things could be even worse next year, <span itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Corporation""><span itemprop=""name""> Citigroup </span></span> Inc (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/citigroup"" id=""5fc3478fdcb6d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""241"">C</a></span>). analysts including Anthony Yuen said last month. “A mild 2019-2020 winter could be disastrous for global gas pricing in 2020,” they warned.</p>
<p>The Final Countdown</p>
<p>Next year marks the start of rules on ship fuel designed to drastically cut down emissions of sulfur, and this half will be dominated by preparations for the sweeping change by shipowners, ports and producers. The upgrade requires refineries to churn out completely new fuels that will start being heavily used for the first time on a global scale in the fourth quarter as owners get ready.</p>
<p>Counter-intuitively perhaps, until early June prices for the kinds of supplies used in most parts of the world today (that will mostly be prohibited) actually rose compared with the fuel that will allow owners to comply. That was in large part driven by lower output of heavier crudes from the likes of Venezuela -- depriving refineries of supplies that they process to make heavy bunker fuel for ships. More recently though, premiums for the lower-sulfur product have begun rebounding, and it’s the spread between compliant and non-compliant grades that’s set to become more important over the rest of the year.</p>    <div class=""clear""></div>"

<p>(CIO) Looking for impending trouble in the economy? There’s a new worry: Junk bonds, which suffer the most in a recession, are looking at a surge in credit-rating downgrades vs. upgrades.</p>
<p></p>
<p>According to Moody’s Analytics, the ratio of high-yield downgrades to upgrades has doubled—to 2.38:1 for January-September 2019, from 1.09:1 for calendar 2018. A revenue fall is to blame.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“A pronounced slowing by business sales, both with and excluding energy products, helps to the explain the marked excess of high-yield downgrades over upgrades after omitting primarily event-driven rating changes,” wrote John Lonski, the organization’s chief economist.</p>

<p>(ZeroHedge) In the past month, a feud has erupted in the financial media and across capital markets between defenders of the Fed, who praise the return of its unprecedented easing in the form of $60BN in monthly T-Bill purchases, by refusing to call it by its real name, and instead the Fed's fan club calls it <em>""not QE"" </em>(just so it doesn't appear that ten years after the Fed first launched QE, we are back to square one), and those who happen to be intellectually honest, and call the largest permanent expansion in the Fed's balance sheet, meant to ease financial conditions and boost liquidity across the financial sector, for what it is: <strong>QE</strong>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is this same ""not QE"" that has boosted the Fed's balance sheet by $200BN in one month, <strong>the fastest rate of increase since the financial crisis</strong>.</p>

<p>(FXEmpire) Gold has been consolidating for about 6-week after peaking in September. The COT report remains near-term bearish with commercial shorts just off record levels – it will take time to work down those positions.

<p></p>
<p>The pretax charge, driven by market conditions, is almost entirely non-cash and primarily relates to goodwill, intangible assets, and fixed assets, said Schlumberger (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/schlumberger-ltd"" id=""5fc34ae9bb411"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8354"">SLB</a></span>), which also flagged continued slowdown in North America’s drilling growth.</p>

<p>(ZeroHedge) <strong>An unprecedented October blizzard that hit just before harvest time has absolutely devastated farms all across the U.S.</strong> <strong>heartland. </strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>As you will see below, one state lawmaker in North Dakota is saying that the crop losses will be “as devastating as we’ve ever seen”. This is the exact scenario that I have been warning about for months, and now it has materialized.  <strong>Due to endless rain and horrific flooding early in the year, many farmers in the middle of the country faced very serious delays in getting their crops planted. </strong> So we really needed good weather at the end of the season so that the crops could mature and be harvested in time, and that did not happen.  Instead, the historic blizzard that we just witnessed dumped up to 2 feet of snow from Colorado to Minnesota.  In fact, one city in North Dakota actually got 30 inches of snow. <strong>In the end, this is going to go down as one of the worst crop disasters that the Midwest has ever seen, and ultimately this crisis is going to affect all of us.</strong></p>

<p>(ZeroHedge) China ramped up Soybean purchases from Brazil last week, despite President Trump showboating a potential $50 billion agriculture deal with Beijing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Multiple traders told Reuters that Brazilian soybeans are more appealing to commercial importers, especially ones from China, who are looking for deep discounts. </p>

<p></p>
<p>... evinced as powerful a response as negative interest rates, and for good reason: long seen as the last ""red line"" of central banks before they are forced to admit defeat, some $15 trillion in debt now trades with a negative yield, making a farce of conventional finance which operates on the simple premise of ""time value of money"", which has been flipped on its head, <strong>as negative rates mean that the value of money is now negative.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Meanwhile, with the ECB recently cutting rates further into negative territory, and the BOJ likewise set for even more negative rates, a rare public debate among establishment economists has erupted as a growing number of policymakers question the value of its deep foray into unconventional monetary policy. Just one month ago, Dutch Central Bank chief, a frequent critic of the bank’s ultra-easy monetary policy, unloaded on ECB outgoing president Mario Draghi: ""This broad package of measures, in particular restarting the asset purchase program, is disproportionate to the present economic conditions, and there are sound reasons to doubt its effectiveness. There are increasing signs of scarcity of low-risk assets, distorted pricing in financial markets and excessive risk-seeking behaviour in the housing markets.""</p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

        <p>Investing.com - The strong dollar is ""impeding"" U.S. exports of wheat, corn, and soybeans.</p>

<p>The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/us-dollar-index"" id=""5fc3476297ada"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8827"">US Dollar Index</a></span> closed up 101.64, or 0.52%.</p>
<p>A strong dollar will continue to ""impede"" U.S. exports and is causing many producers to reconsider their crop rotations, switching from wheat to more profitable and higher performing crops, such as corn and soybeans, according to a report by CoBank.</p>
<p>A combination of market factors is reconfiguring the U.S. grain and farm supply industries and commodity prices.</p>
<p>According to a new report from CoBank, continued low commodity prices, increased foreign competition and the strong U.S. dollar will increase stress on American crop and animal supply chains.</p>
<p>This will increase industry consolidation, which shall launch the next phase in the growth of the agricultural industry.</p>
<p>Prices across the crops sector shall remain low as a result of a this oversupply in <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc3476297bfa"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918""> corn</a></span>, and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc3476297d44"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916""> soybeans</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc3476297e7b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">wheat</a></span>.</p>
<p>Whilst low commodity prices are also propelling consumption and overall global demand.</p>
<p>Strong production will outpace demand during the next three years, unless there is an extreme weather event in a major agricultural producing country.</p>
<p>""The U.S. grain and farm supply industries have reached another historic inflection point that will be good news for some and bad news for others,"" said Tanner Ehmke, CoBank senior economist and author of a new report on industry trends for the next two years. ""The co-ops that thrive through this cycle will be those that offer innovative products and services to their farmer customers, are earnest and unrelenting in controlling costs, are properly aligned in the industry chain, and focused on risk management. These co-ops ultimately end up well positioned as the industry realigns.""</p>
<p>The increased competitiveness of foreign producers – countries like Argentina, Brazil and Russia – have expanded production to take advantage of the export opportunities created by their weaker currencies.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- Timing it right on China’s commodity recovery promises to be hugely profitable.</p>
<p>But traders are finding the channels of information they need to make that call are getting choked off by travel bans and other steps to combat the coronavirus. So they’re relying on unorthodox sources like road congestion data to give them an edge.</p>
<p>TomTom’s live traffic updates give an indication of how quickly different parts of the world’s biggest consumer of commodities are returning to work after an extended Lunar New Year holiday ended on Monday. Heavier traffic signals more fuel demand but also more workers in plants and factories potentially consuming more raw materials.</p>
<p></p><p>Traders are on alert after Xi Jinping ordered nearly all of the country to start work again, sparking debate about when they need to start buying again to meet the potential demand surge. As well as parsing traffic data to make their predictions, they’re scouring social media, keeping an eye on local news reports and decoding government statements, according to conversations with traders of everything from <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc3509e0e6b8"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span> to <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc3509e0ecf1"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">crude oil</a></span>.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>There’s a lot at stake. Commodity prices including oil and iron ore have collapsed as the virus dents demand. But when China starts buying again there could be a significant reversal.</p><p></p>
<p>“The trading community is scouring social media, news reports and chatting with each other for information,” said Jia Zheng, a metals and energy trader at Shanghai Minghong Investment Management Co. “Sources of information are far fewer than before because of the virus. Some official industry data, which was frequently updated before, has been unchanged for quite a while.”</p>
<p>So far the picture is mixed at best. Soybean crushers are ramping up production as the government puts a specific emphasis on the resumption of food production. But oil refineries continue to reduce output, coal demand at eastern independent power plants remains low, and activity at many metals processing plants remains subdued.</p>
<p><span itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Corporation""><span itemprop=""name""> Citigroup </span></span> Inc (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/citigroup"" id=""5fc3509e0ee4b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""241"">C</a></span>). analyst Ephrem Ravi, who’s tracking TomTom’s China traffic data, said in a Feb. 11 research note that he found “extremely low levels of activity across all regions.” Power consumption data also points to the economic restart not yet materializing, BOCI Research analysts including Tony Fei said in a note today.</p>
<p>TomTom’s Beijing traffic tracker showed congestion at 11% at 8 a.m. Thursday, down from an average of 62% at the time in 2019.</p>
<p>“Live congestion data for major cities across China shows roads remaining empty despite the end of the public holiday,” Richard Chatterton, an oil analyst for BloombergNEF, said in a Feb. 11 report. “Low levels of road congestion indicate lower levels of passenger car journeys that translate into reduced demand for gasoline.”</p>

Other whispers making the rounds were reports that southern Iowa did receive much-needed rain.

Besides weather concerns in parts of Iowa, there was chatter of concern that&nbsp;fields across the state had an insect problem including low levels soybean aphids, Japanese beetles, potato leaf-hoppers, and corn rootworm as gray leaf spot is becoming more prevalent. This led to short covering and the market settled in the green after the latest tumble in prices. December corn is currently trading at 333 ¾ which is 1 cent lower. The trading range has been 335 ¼ to 333 ½.</p>

The EIA said production averaged 908,000 barrels a day, down 23,000 barrels from a week ago and down 131,000 barrels from a year ago. The amount of gasoline supplied to the market was down for the second week in a row, while blending demand did improve, but is still way below a year ago.

The Bannockburn World Currency Index rose by more than 0.5% to new two-year highs.&nbsp;</p>

The yield rose a few basis points on the week to poke above 3.3% for the first time in over a year.

That said, it did sell a 5-year euro-denominated issue with a negative yield for the first time. Still, a string of high-profile failures continues, including a car manufacturer, real estate developer, and chipmaker last week suggests there may not be much appetite for any aggressive measures to tighten financial conditions.</p>

<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/us-dollar-index"" id=""5fc34e74bf77b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8827"">Dollar Index</a></span>:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The Dollar Index hovered around the trough a little above 92.00 last week. It barely held above the month's low set on November 9, a little below 92.15. It probably takes a break of the spike low on September 1 to about 91.75 to signal a breakout. The momentum indicators show room to the downside, albeit limited before getting stretched. Perhaps a macro development, like a trade agreement between the UK and EU, could be the spark. Still, with the virus continuing to ravage Europe, three-month Euribor at record lows, and the implicit threat of verbal intervention if the euro approaches $1.20, it does not seem time for a sustained breakout.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/eur-usd"" id=""5fc34e74bf84b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""1"">Euro</a></span>:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Within the $1.16-$1.20 range that has confined the euro for a few months, the euro looks comfortable in a narrow $1.1750-$1.1900 range. It spent last week on the $1.18 handle. The MACD and Slow Stochastic show momentum still favoring the upside, and the five-day moving average is about the 20-day. However, we expect the market to be reluctant to push the euro much higher. The speed to which it came off after seeing $1.1920 on November 9 warns of possibly weak conviction. A weak preliminary PMI will increase concerns of a new economic contraction after the Q3 rebound.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-jpy"" id=""5fc34e74bf902"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""3"">Japanese Yen</a></span>:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The dollar takes a seven-day decline into next week. The dramatic short squeeze lifted the dollar from eight-month lows near JPY103.20 to around JPY105.65, sparked by Pfizer's (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/pfizer"" id=""5fc34e74bf9b4"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""7989"">PFE</a></span>) news on November 9, has almost been completely unwound. The greenback spent the pre-weekend session near JPY103.60. While the technical indicators point lower, the selling pressure appears to have dried up in recent days. A break of JPY103 would likely spur some official comments, but it may take a move above JPY104.20 to stabilize the tone.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/gbp-usd"" id=""5fc34e74bfa6e"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""2"">British Pound</a></span>:&nbsp; </strong>Sterling rose by about 0.75% last week, its third weekly advance in a row. It met selling pressure a little over $1.33 like it did earlier the month. Another trade talk deadline is seen early next week, and we suspect there would be a larger market reaction if there was no deal than if there were. Many talk about the potential for as much as a 5% swing in either direction, which seems exaggerated. The momentum indicators are at a mature part of their cycles, and sterling is up around 2.5% so far this month. The one-week implied volatility finished the week near 10.25%, its lowest weekly close in four weeks. Sterling has also gained around 1% against the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/gbp-eur"" id=""5fc34e74bfb22"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""1751"">euro</a></span> over the past two weeks. Our thought is to fade dramatic moves.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-cad"" id=""5fc34e74bfbe4"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""7"">Canadian Dollar</a></span>:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The greenback's gains scored in the wake of the Pfizer news against the Canadian dollar were partly unwound last week. In fact, the US dollar had approached the (61.8%) retracement objective found near CAD1.3020. The momentum indicators did not move much last week as the US dollar traded within the previous week's range. Next week, the light economic calendar reinforces our sense that the main drivers of the Canadian dollar are not to be found in Canada but the broader appetite for risk. Although the US fell to lows for the year on November 9 near CAD1.2930, initial support is still seen around CAD1.30. The CAD1.3100-CAD1.3120 area may provide the nearby cap.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/aud-usd"" id=""5fc34e74bfc98"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""5"">Australian Dollar</a></span>:</strong>&nbsp; The Australian dollar finished its third consecutive weekly advance on a firm tone above $0.7300. However, it spent the week in a narrow band around there and could not take out the previous week's high near $0.7340, despite a larger than expected jump in employment. The Australian dollar has appreciated by 4% this month, and the momentum indicators are getting stretched. While a marginal new high is possible, the September 1 and year-high near $0.7415 seems too far.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-mxn"" id=""5fc34e74bfd4a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""39"">Mexican Peso</a></span>:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The dollar posted its lowest weekly close since early March against the Mexican peso, below MXN20.10. Since the end of July, the greenback has managed to close higher on a weekly basis only three times. It is not Mexico's macro situation that underpins the peso and has driven nearly 5.5% already this month. Portfolio capital flows, drawn to its relatively high yields (e.g., ~4.25% on three-month bills), appear to be the main considerations on top of a trade surplus and strong worker remittances. The peso is also a favorite of the speculative community and carry-trades. A break of MXN20.00 is possible near-term, and the pressure is relentless. The momentum indicators are stretched and reflect that the dollar has fallen from the MXN22.00 spike high on November 4.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-cny"" id=""5fc34e74bfdfc"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""2111"">Chinese Yuan</a></span>:</strong>&nbsp;The yuan strengthened by about two-thirds of a percentage point last week to make it about 2% richer on the month. Year-to-date, its 6.1% gain leads the emerging market currencies. Even shallow pullbacks are bought. Old support for the US dollar, near CNY6.60, now serves as resistance. Given China's importance as a trading partner, it was thought the yuan appreciation would give scope for other emerging Asia currencies to appreciate. South Korea and Thailand showed that this might not be the case and dollar invoicing is still common even when a US company is not involved. If the yuan's adjustment is on par with the one in 2010-2011 or 2017-2018, the dollar could be headed toward CNY6.40. Alternatively, the US Treasury opined that the yuan was 5% undervalued. If this was corrected, the dollar would be near CNY6.20.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc34e74bfead"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">Gold</a></span>:</strong>&nbsp; The combination of the prospects for a vaccine and that Shelton looks unlikely to join the Fed sent gold down for a second consecutive week and the first back-to-back weekly loss in three months. Support was found a little above the previous week's low near $1850. The upticks were not impressive, and the bounce stalled near $1880. A break of $1850 could open the door to $1800, but we suspect bargain hunters are lurking and are looking for some sign that the selling pressure has abated and will likely react strongly to any reversal pattern in the price action. A move above $1900 would begin healing the scar tissue,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc34e74bff63"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">Oil</a></span>: </strong>If the prospects of a vaccine weighed on gold prices by reducing the perceived need for a safe-haven, it helped oil by strengthening the case for demand. January WTI rose a little more than 4% last after surging around 11.5% over the previous two weeks. Except for a brief and limited disruption in the middle of the week, the price of oil stayed within Monday's range (~$40.40-$42.35). The November 9 high was set near $43.35, and that remains the near-term objective. Initial support is seen near $41.80. The MACD is trending higher, but the Slow Stochastic is flatlining near its highs.</p>
<p><strong>US Rates:</strong>&nbsp; The US <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/rates-bonds/u.s.-10-year-bond-yield"" id=""5fc34e74c001d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""23705"">10-year</a></span> yield slipped six basis points last week to finish near 0.83% and is four basis points lower than the end of last month. Speculation that the Fed will shift its purchases to the longer-dated maturities countered the ""reflation trade"" that has helped lift the yield to&nbsp; 0.97%, where it stalled. With the two-year anchored by the Fed's steady rate policy, the lion's share of the decline in the 10-year yield filtered to the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/rates-bonds/u.s.-2-year-bond-yield"" id=""5fc34e74c00d0"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""23701"">2-</a></span>10-year <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/rates-bonds/10-2-year-treasury-yield-spread"" id=""5fc34e74c0180"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""1141794"">yield curve</a></span>.

The 10-year note futures' momentum indicators suggest there is more upside potential, but prices are stalling around 138-16, a (61.8%) retracement objective of the decline since the November 5 high.</p>

Specifically, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/ncdex-soybean-futures"" id=""5fc349c9ae797"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""1013442"">soybeans</a></span>.  As a result of trade wars and tariffs, etc., more people are conscious of the fact that soybeans exist and are a tradable commodity than at most times in the past. </p><p></p>
<p>In a nutshell, the common perception is “if trade war news is good that is good for beans and vice versa.”  And that is probably true.  But many commodities have a personality of their own.  With a commodity like soybeans it has a lot to do with the growing cycle in the U.S.  Generally speaking, it goes like this:</p>
<p></p><ul>
<li><strong>Early in the year:</strong> no beans are in the ground, uncertainty is high, prices tend to rise</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p></p><ul>
<li><strong>Spring:</strong> planting goes well, prices cool off OR planting does NOT go well and prices continue to rise</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p></p><ul>
<li><strong>Summer:</strong> By now it is apparent whether or not it is a good year or a bad year for beans, price tends to decline</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p></p><ul>
<li><strong>Late summer/harvest season:</strong> The game is over for this year; prices tend to decline (often sharply)</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p></p><p><strong>Today we will focus on “Late summer/harvest season”.</strong></p><p></p>
<p>But first let’s take a look at the ‘Big Picture”.</p>
<p>As we can see in Figure 1, soybeans have support in the 790 to 850 range (technically this means $7.90 a bushel to $8.50 a bushel). </p><div class=""outerEleWrapper"">

<p>As we can see in Figure 2, this range was previously something of a “DMZ” for beans.  Beans would spike up quickly through this range to the ultimate top and then collapse just as quickly back down through this range.  Then after about 2007 beans spent most of their time north of this range, and several times it served as support – just as it is trying to do now. </p><div class=""outerEleWrapper"">

<p>So like I said, if any perceived “good news” pops up regarding trade with China, beans would likely be expected to “pop” higher.</p>
<p>Um, but in the meantime….</p>
<p>Late Summer/Harvest Season</p>
<p>We will define this period as the end of September trading day #5 through the end of October Trading Day #2.</p>
<p>Now let’s consider the performance of soybean futures during this period from year-to-year.  Each full $1 movement in the price of soybean futures contract (which entails 5,000 bushels of soybeans) is worth $5,000.  Therefore, each 1-cent movement in the price of a soybean futures contract is worth $50.</p>
<p>Now let’s suppose that each and every year we bought one soybean futures contract at the close of the 5th trading day of September each year, and sold it at the close of the 2nd trading day of October. </p>
<p>Figure 3 displays the cumulative performance of this particular(ly unfortunate) strategy.</p><div class=""outerEleWrapper"">

<p>Finally, some fact and Figures:</p>
<p>*# times UP = 15 (30% of the time)</p>
<p>*# time DOWN = 34 (68% of the time)</p>
<p>*# times unchanged = 1</p>
<p>*Largest Gain = +$8,475 in 1974</p>
<p>*Largest Loss = (-$13,200 in 2011)</p>
<p>*Average Gain = +$1,436</p>
<p>*Average Loss = (-$2,582)</p>
<p>Here are the wrong things and the right things to take away from all of this:</p>
<p>*Most people look at Figure 1 and immediately think “there is no way beans are going up.”  This is incorrect.  Soybeans actually went up 30% of the time. </p>
<p>*Still, historically there has been roughly a 7 in 10 change of beans declining during this period</p>
<p>*Making matters worse is that the average loss was almost 1.8 time greater than the average win.</p>
<p><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></p>
<p>There is every chance that beans could advance between now and the close on 10/2. </p>
<p>But history suggests it is a bad bet.</p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

    </div>
        <p>(Bloomberg) -- Planting season, always a critical time for farmers, just became more nerve-wracking for U.S. growers of soybeans and corn.</p>
<p>In a move that caught many in U.S. agriculture by surprise, China on Wednesday announced planned tariffs on American shipments of the two crops. The measures are set to take effect in 60 days. That gives some farmers the opportunity of making a last-gasp switch to another crop. But for others -- perhaps most -- it’s too late to make a change.</p>
<p>""It puts it into flux,"" said Dave Walton, a farmer in Wilton, Iowa, who intends to watch prices closely in the next few weeks amid expectations that China and the U.S. will negotiate to avoid an outright trade war. ""We can switch acres from beans to corn if necessary.""</p>
<p>North Americans farmers have until around the end of June to put soybean seeds in the ground, while corn planting typically ends a month earlier. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said last week there will be 88 million acres of corn and 89 million acres of soybeans, covering a combined area larger than California.</p>
<p>The stakes are especially high this year given the parlous state of the agricultural economy. A succession of bumper harvests has led to gluts and depressed crop prices. The USDA projects net farm income will fall to a 12-year low of $59.5 billion, less than half the record level seen in 2013.</p>
<p>The specter of trade disruption has been hanging over the U.S. farm economy ever since Donald Trump was elected on a platform that included promises to challenge China and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement.</p>
<p>The Chinese tariffs drew warnings from Republicans that a trade war would deliver an economic blow in politically important areas, jeopardizing the party’s prospects in congressional elections in November.</p>
<p>There’s still uncertainty over whether the tariffs will be enacted, how high they will ultimately be, and how long they might last, said Chris Hurt, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana.</p>
<p>That was reflected in the market reaction on Wednesday. Amid surging volumes in the futures markets, soybeans and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc34f145b35a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">corn futures</a></span> pared some of their early losses. Soy closed 22.75 cents, or 2.2 percent, lower at $10.1525 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. A 50-cent drop may lead to some acres shifting to corn but a major change would require at least a $1 drop, Hurt said.</p>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34f145b817"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">Soybeans</a></span> for May delivery rose 0.1 percent to $10.165 at 8:54 a.m. in Chicago on Thursday.</p>
<p>North Dakota farmer Monte Peterson had planned to plant more soybeans than corn this year. He says that’s now up in the air, as the soy market may take a while to adjust to the tariffs.</p>
<p>The predicament of Illinois soybean and corn farmer Chris Gould is probably more typical. Gould said he plans to get out his spreadsheets to calculate profitability and see if a change is needed, but it may be too late to alter course.</p>
<p>Most North American farmers have by now purchased seed, fertilizer and other inputs based on what they intend to plant in the spring. Even though they can tweak their plans, those big costs largely lock them in.</p>
<p>Furthermore, freezing temperatures and snow in the Midwest are keeping some farmers off their fields right now. Adverse weather could end up having a greater impact on acreage than concerns about trade tariffs because soybeans can be planted later than corn.</p>
<p>April Hemmes, an Iowa farmer, is one farmer waiting for the snow to melt so that planting can begin. She says she sold 25 percent of her upcoming soybean crop on Tuesday amid uncertainty about what China might do and also because of earlier price gains.</p>
<p>“Let’s just hope this is a war of words and none of these tariffs are ever enacted,” she said. “These words and actions cost farmers real money.”</p>

<p>Much of the recent rally in agriculture commodities, or ags, has been predicated on inclement crop weather and poorer-than-anticipated yields reported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). But now, those trends seem to be turning and prices could unwind on higher supply worries, leaving one less bright spot for commodity bulls.</p>
<p></p><h2 dir=""ltr""><strong>China Politics Complicating The Game Too</strong></h2>
<p>While there are still some genuine concerns for crop prospects, politics are also in play. Speculation has risen in recent days that Beijing will make good on its pledge to buy $50 billion of U.S. agricultural commodities <em>only</em> if the White House cancels new upcoming tariffs on Chinese imports in December — a sign of the continuous twists in the trade war between the two countries.</p>
<p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img title=""Corn Weekly TTM"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic9f56fdb5a8d4a5868db6b946aa62d02f.png"" alt=""Corn Weekly TTM""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Corn Weekly TTM</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p>The three key U.S. ags components fell in Tuesday’s trading, though not by too much. Soybeans and wheat lost 0.7% each, while corn fell 1.2%.</p>
<p>Corn’s losses were larger than the rest. The USDA Crop Production report issued Oct. 10 showed a national corn yield estimate of 168.4, slightly higher than the 168.2 the USDA estimated in September.</p>
<h2><strong> Corn Yields Not Expected To Fall Much</strong></h2><p></p>
<p><strong> </strong>Agweb noted of the USDA report:<strong> </strong></p>
<p></p><blockquote>“As farmers across the U.S. rush to save and harvest bushels sitting in the field, USDA isn’t budging much on its national estimate for corn yield.”</blockquote><p></p>
<p>Seth Meyer of University of Missouri’s Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute thinks it will be tough to see the USDA make a dramatic revision to the national corn yield, largely due to the time of the year. He says: </p>
<p></p><blockquote>“It’s possible, but it’s unlikely at this point. Historically, those yields start to really narrow down by the October estimate. And yes, we can talk about the crop is behind, a little bit less mature, but there still isn’t a strong relationship over time. You shouldn’t expect large yield and area changes from this point going forward.”</blockquote><p></p>
<p></p><h2><strong> </strong><strong>Bull Fatigue Might Be Setting In For Soy And Wheat Too</strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong>Dan Hueber, a veteran ags analyst who writes the daily Hueber Report out of Lake Charles, Illinois, says bull fatigue may be setting in not only for corn but for the other two ags as well. He notes:</p>
<blockquote>“We should keep in mind as well that we have now seen prices steadily advance over the past six weeks … so the legs on these bulls could be getting just a bit weary.”<strong> </strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>“After all, it is not easy to run uphill, even when you have tailwinds generated by winter temperatures and encouraging trade negotiations.”<strong> </strong></blockquote>
<p>Hueber said a generally clear weather forecast this week has also eased worries about recent inclement weather in the Northern Plains and frosty temperatures that blanketed a wide swath of the upper Midwest. Plantings were, meanwhile, going on well in competing countries. <strong> </strong></p>

<p>Rains have arrived in South America, with AgRural estimating Brazilian soybean planting being 11% complete, though still behind last year’s 20% pace. <strong> </strong>Further south in Argentina, farmers were focusing on corn, and it is estimated that they have 24% planted, 2.7% behind last year.  The dry conditions may not be providing the best start, though, and the preliminary rating report stated that just 31.5% of the crop is good, 56% fair, and 12.5% poor. <strong> </strong></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><strong>China Says It Will Buy Based On Demand, Not Pledge To The U.S.</strong><strong> </strong></h2><p></p>
<p>Last but not least is the China story.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Chinese Agriculture Minister Geng Shuang said the country’s ags buying would be dependent on demand and not necessarily the $50 billion tag with which to satisfy U.S. demands. Minister Geng pointed out that for this year alone, China had already purchased 20 million metric tonne of soybeans, 700,000 metric tonnes of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/lean-hogs"" id=""5fc34aaa663de"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8913"">pork</a></span>, 320,000 metric tonnes of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-cotton-no.2"" id=""5fc34aaa664b6"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8851"">cotton</a></span> and 700,000 million metric tonnes of sorghum.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>The minister’s words were an ominous warning to grains markets veterans like Hueber who noted that even during the peak of the commodity bubble, when soybeans were north of $17 a bushel and corn was above $6 a bushel, China’s combined annual buying of the two from the U.S. was only around $27 billion. Added Hueber:<strong> </strong></p>
<p></p><blockquote>“Unlike offering sympathy to someone who has been going through a rough patch, it is not the thought or sentiment that will count.”</blockquote><p></p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

Like beans, the corn market is a highly cyclical market. This is in large part due to the planting and growing season (as explained here).  This article is about a “seasonal/cyclical” speculative play using options on Teucrium Corn Fund (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/etfs/teucrium-corn"" id=""5fc34be503f69"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""44788"">CORN</a></span>).</p>

<p>*The trade highlighted is NOT a “recommendation”, only an example of how to speculate on a potential move using options in order to achieve limited risk and unlimited profit potential.</p>
<p></p>
<p>*Options on ticker CORN are very thinly traded.  So, any investor who might choose to wade in needs to be aware that they may need to consider using a limit order in order to avoid significant slippage.</p>

<p>It is critical to understand that this is the “average” for what has happened in the past and should in no way be viewed as a “roadmap”.  Still, the point is pretty clear – late in the year through the month of April tends to be the “bullish” time for corn.</p>
<p>Figure 2 displays that bullish sentiment for corn was recently quite low.  While this by no means guarantees a rally, historically this often a signal that downside risk may be relatively low.</p><!--start-image-->

<p>So, is this really a good idea?  I am not actually saying that it is.  As always with this blog, this is not a “recommendation”, only an “example.”  Let’s hit the most important points to consider with this example.</p>
<p><strong>A few things to note:</strong></p>
<p>*This position qualifies as “serious bottom picking” – which is generally considered to be a loser’s bet.  However, the mitigating factor here is that we are risking only $90 (or possibly less if a limit order is used to enter) per contract.  And position sizing should be kept on the small size.  For example, a trader with $25,000 might buy a 3-lot and risk 1.1% of their trading capital. </p>
<p>*If CORN does NOT advance at anytime in the next 5 months this trade is certain to lose money.</p>
<p>*If CORN were to rally to its it’s 2019 high of $17.55 a share, this position would roughly triple in value.</p>
<p>So, the bottom-line questions for a trader in considering this trade are:</p>
<p>*Are you OK with risking $90 per contract on the hopes that corn will rise between now and the end of April 2020?</p>
<p>*If you do enter the trade, how many contracts will you buy/what percentage of your trading capital will you risk?</p>
<p>*If CORN fails to rally will you simply hold the options or will you consider exiting early if – for example – a key support level is broken?</p>
<p>*If CORN does advance at what share price or option trade profit level will you, a) take a profit or b) adjust the trade?</p>
<p>Buying inexpensive call options is something of a siren song for a lot of traders and can lead to mistakes.  But sometimes it can make a lot of sense as long as you:</p>
<p>*Put as many factors in your favor</p>
<p>*Don’t bet the ranch</p>
<p>*Formulate and follow a trade plan</p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

        <p>By Geoffrey Smith&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investing.com -- Peaceful protests at the killing of an unarmed black man by police degenerate into riots and looting, while President Trump threatens governors with the imposition of martial law. China is going slow on its purchases of U.S. agricultural goods, while Germany is planning another big stimulus package - with its auto industry set to be one of the big beneficiaries. And oil prices are rising again as Russia and OPEC close in on an extension of their deal on output restraint. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, June 2nd.</p>
<p><strong>1. U.S. cities hit by more violence</strong></p>
<p>U.S. cities were rocked by another night of protests triggered by the killing of an unarmed black man by Minneapolis police.&nbsp; Two separate autopsies conducted on George Floyd came to the conclusion of homicide, but offered different causes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The protests were marked on the one side by outbreaks of looting, and on the other by violence against both media and peaceful protestors as well as violent ones. President Donald Trump threatened in a call with state governors to send in combat troops if they failed to bring the situation in their states under control.</p>
<p>New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said New York would face another curfew tonight after widespread violence and looting in lower Manhattan overnight. &nbsp;The protests threaten to derail the reopening of much of the U.S. economy, which analysts have repeatedly said depends heavily on consumer and business confidence rebounding.</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;China goes slow on farm goods purchases</strong></p>
<p>Chinese government officials told major state-run agricultural companies to pause purchases of some U.S. farm goods including <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc350b711653"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span>, Bloomberg reported, in a move that appears to undermine Beijing’s previous promises to increase purchases under the ‘Phase 1’ trade deal signed in January.</p>
<p>State-owned traders Cofco and Sinograin were ordered to suspend purchases while Chinese officials also told state-buyers to halt American cotton and corn imports, Bloomberg reported. It also noted that some pork purchases have been delayed.</p>
<p>The move is the latest development to reflect worsening relations between Beijing and Washington after the enactment of a new security law that the U.S. said ended the autonomy and freedoms of Hong Kong.</p>
<p><strong>3. Stocks set to open higher, eye on reopenings</strong></p>
<p>U.S. stock markets are poised to open higher, shrugging off the almost nationwide rioting and accompanying ballyhoo.</p>
<p>Markets are focusing more on the lifting of restrictions on the normal operation of businesses as efforts to mitigate the Covid-19 pandemic get a helping hand from the start of summer.</p>
<p>By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/us-30-futures"" id=""5fc350b711ab6"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8873"">Dow Jones 30 futures</a></span> contract was up 178 points, or 0.7%, while the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/us-spx-500-futures"" id=""5fc350b711c20"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8839"">S&amp;P 500 futures</a></span> contract was up 0.6% and the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/nq-100-futures"" id=""5fc350b711d27"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8874"">Nasdaq 100 futures</a></span> contract was up 0.6%.</p>
<p>One stock in focus later will be Apple (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/apple-computer-inc"" id=""5fc350b711e3f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""6408"">AAPL</a></span>), which has cut prices for its iPhones in China in an attempt to revive flagging sales in the wake of the pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>4. Germany pulls Europe higher with new stimulus package</strong></p>
<p>The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/germany-30"" id=""5fc350b711f89"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""172"">German</a></span> stock market hit a three-month high, pulling European markets in its wake, amid reports that the government will debate a further stimulus package to the economy Tuesday.</p>
<p>Local media reports put the size of the package at between 80 and 100 billion euros (($89 to $111 billion), and said much of it will be aimed at the auto industry, which supports over 12% of the country’s jobs directly and indirectly.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Europe, the EU and U.K. begin their last round of talks on trading relations after the current post-Brexit transitional phase lapses at the end of the year. The U.K. government has said it won’t seek an extension of the transition, which has kept conditions for businesses effectively &nbsp;unchanged since the U.K. formally left the bloc earlier this year.</p>
<p><strong>5. API oil inventories due as Russia, OPEC mull extension of output deal</strong></p>
<p>Oil prices surged again on hopes that OPEC and Russia will extend their agreement on output restraint, which is due to lapse at the end of June.</p>
<p>The Russian government is scheduled to discuss the issue at a meeting Tuesday, according to local media reports, with at least one suggesting that Russia’s preference is for an extension of only one month.</p>
<p>In the U.S., the American Petroleum Institute will report its weekly data on U.S. inventories of crude and refined products at 4:30 PM ET as usual.</p>
<p>By 6:30 AM, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc350b7120c4"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">U.S. crude</a></span> futures were up 2.6% at $36.40 a barrel, while <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/brent-oil"" id=""5fc350b7121f6"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8833"">Brent</a></span> futures were up 2.9% at $39.42.</p>    <div class=""clear""></div>"

    </div>
        <p></p><p>(Bloomberg) -- Chinese firms have been snapping up U.S. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc3500d55d48"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span> this week, but don’t mistake this as a sign of buyer confidence in upcoming trade talks.</p><p></p>
<p>The companies, which received a fresh 2 million-ton quota from Beijing to import American beans free of retaliatory tariffs, have been seeking soy every day so far. That’s likely because they want to rush through orders in case the talks fail and imports are halted, said Darin Friedrichs, a senior analyst at INTL FCStone’s Asia commodities division.</p>
<p>“The Chinese soybean purchases are a necessity and may be a sign that the crushers want to get these grades in quickly because things could change on talks,” Friedrichs said.</p>
<p>The wariness of commodity traders is perhaps  understandable given the whipsawing in relations between President Donald Trump and counterpart Xi Jinping over the past year. Chinese firms were issued tariff waivers in July as Beijing offered Washington an olive branch, only to see shipments stopped about a month later after talks fell apart. Top negotiators from the two countries are expected to meet in Washington on Oct. 10.</p>
<p>The purchases may also be because it makes financial sense right now. Margins on crushing U.S. soybeans in China are higher than those of rival Brazil thanks to the lower prices of American soy when retaliatory tariffs are removed.</p>
<p>Chinese state-owned and private firms bought at least 6 cargoes of U.S. soy, equivalent to about 400,000 tons, said people familiar with the purchases, asking not to be identified because the information is private. That’s on top of 12 to 15 cargoes, or 1 million tons, purchased earlier this week.</p>
<p>No one answered calls to China’s commerce ministry during the National Day holiday, and a fax seeking comment wasn’t immediately responded to.</p>
<p>November soybean futures were little changed at $9.13 a bushel by 4:11 p.m. Singapore time. Prices have gained 3.4% so far this week.</p>    <div class=""clear""></div>"

<p>Speculative investors boosted their net long positions to the most since the week of February 26, according to the latest data snapshot from <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-silver-speculative-net-positions-1621"" id=""5fc348de88a10"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1621"">CFTC</a></span> as of July 23. Meanwhile, exchange-traded funds trimmed 1.13 million troy ounces from physical holdings in the latest trading session, the biggest one-day drop since May 20, according to a Bloomberg report yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>GOLD</strong> prices reached the highest in more than six years on July 19 and have been consolidating in a tight range since then. Central banks remained buyers of the precious metal in June, though China’s buying was at a slower pace than previous months, while Russia and Poland accelerated purchases.</p>
<p>Speculative investors were net buyers of gold for a second consecutive week, according to the latest report as at July 23 from <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-gold-speculative-net-positions-1618"" id=""5fc348de88b11"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1618"">CFTC</a></span>.</p>
<p><strong>PLATINUM</strong> has advanced for a second consecutive month this month and touched the highest since May 1 last week. The metal is hovering below the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement of the April-May drop at 888.16. Speculative accounts are positioned for further gains, having boosted net long positions to the highest since May 14, according to the latest data from CFTC.</p>
<p><strong>PALLADIUM</strong> has trended higher in the past week, climbing the most in a week yesterday. The 55-day moving average was above the 100-day moving average last week for the first time since May 24, which is often interpreted as a medium-term bullish signal.</p>
<p></p><h3><strong>Base metals</strong></h3><p><strong>COPPER</strong> has had a good start to the week as the US-China trade talks get underway again. Hopes are for some significant, tangible progress, though the messages from both sides in the run-up to the meetings appear to be slightly pessimistic, even suggesting not to expect too much. As such, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/copper"" id=""5fc348de88319"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8831"">Copper</a></span>’s gains could be temporary and could retrace in the second half of the week if no positive headlines are forthcoming.</p>
<p>Speculative investors were net buyers for a second week in the week to July 23, but are still net short, albeit at the lowest levels since June 18. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/copper"" id=""5fc348de8843a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8831"">Copper</a></span> has held above the 55-day moving average on a closing basis for the past two weeks.</p>
<p></p><h3><strong>Energy</strong></h3><p><strong>NATURAL GAS</strong> is shaping up for its eighth monthly decline in a row, with this month’s drop the biggest in seven months. The market is still suffering from oversupply and the European heatwave that might have caused a pickup in demand over the past few weeks is coming to an end. Weekly inventory data from EIA to July 19 showed a further increase in stockpiles, the 17th consecutive week of additions.</p>
<p>Speculative investors have been correctly positioned for the move, having increased net short positions to the most since March 2016 in the latest reporting week to July 23. China’s <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/natural-gas"" id=""5fc348de88557"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8862"">natural gas</a></span> imports in June were down 10.3% from a year earlier to just below three million metric tons. However, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) imports were up almost 15% from a year earlier in the month, and up 2.2% from the previous month. Australia became the top LNG supplier to China in June, delivering 2.39 metric tons.</p>
<p>The demand outlook continues to dominate <strong>CRUDE OIL</strong> direction, with gloomy forecasts applying pressure on prices. Disappointing manufacturing PMI data out of the US and Germany last week added to the downward pressure.</p>
<p>There has been some level of support provided by the tensions in the Straits of Hormuz, with a stronger military presence in the area deemed necessary to protect supply routes. In addition, the number of US rigs in production fell to the lowest since February as at July 26, according to the Baker Hughes index, which might suggest lower supply from that region. China imported a record 7.72 million tons of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc348de88668"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">crude oil</a></span> from Saudi Arabia in June, the latest China customs data show.</p>
<p>West Texas Intermediate (WTI) flirted with the 200- and 55-day moving averages at $56.835 and $56.995 respectively toward the end of last week, and today saw the first opening price above the 200-day average in two weeks. WTI is now at $57.13 and also trading above the 55-day moving average.</p>

<p></p><h3><strong>Agriculturals</strong></h3><p><strong>WHEAT</strong> looks set to snap a two-month rising streak this month, holding below the 100-month moving average for an 11th straight month. Speculative investors were net sellers of the commodity for a third consecutive week, reducing net long positions to the lowest in six weeks.</p>
<p>An industry agency in Russia raised its forecast for the country’s wheat crops to 76.4 million tons for this season from 76.1 million at the previous estimate. However, it noted that a lack of rain in Siberia, where harvesting is due to commence at the end of August, could disrupt this forecast. Meanwhile, Argentina, the world’s sixth biggest producer, is looking at a record output for this season, and could increase its portion of global wheat exports to 7.7%.</p>
<p><strong>SOYBEAN</strong> prices are finding support from speculation that China is about to increase its imports of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc348de88775"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">US soybeans</a></span> as the trade negotiations with the US restart. Indeed, the Xinhua News agency has reported that “several million tons” of US soybeans have been shipped to China since the two leaders agreed to resume talks last month. There are also rumours that some China companies will be given dispensation to have tariffs on US soy imports waived.</p>
<p>Speculative accounts were net sellers of the commodity in the week to July 23, pulling net long positions from near-six month highs, according to <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-soybeans-speculative-net-positions-1811"" id=""5fc348de88c13"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1811"">CFTC</a></span> data. Prices are hovering above the 200-day moving average at 8.7823 as the 55-day moving average is poised to cross above the 100-day moving average for the first time since April 17.</p>

In the overnight electronic session, the December corn is currently trading at 409 ¾ which is 4 ½ cents higher. The trading range has been 411 ¾ to 404.</div>

U.S. ethanol imports averaged 29,000 barrels a day, a seven-week high and the 11&nbsp;out of the last 15 weeks with recorded imports. Still waiting to hear what type of volume numbers the Chinese has set their sights to in the U.S. ethanol market. The next corn for ethanol use will be the November 10&nbsp;USDA reports.

    </div>
        <p>Investing.com - U.S. soybean futures edged higher on Thursday to trade just below a six-week peak hit earlier in the week as concerns over a disruption to supplies from Brazil boosted prices.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34431bb4de"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">US soybeans</a></span> for May delivery ticked up 1.52 cents, or 0.15%, to trade at $10.1213 a bushel during U.S. morning hours.</p>
<p>A day earlier, soybean prices lost 8.0 cents, or 0.79%, to settle at $10.1060, as investors cashed out of the market to lock in gains from a rally which took prices to a six-week high of $10.3200 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A strike by Brazilian truck drivers protesting high fuel prices continued for the ninth day on Thursday, threatening to hold up grains exports at the nation's second-largest grain hub in Paranagua.</p>
<p>Brazil is a major soybean exporter and competes with the U.S. for business on the global market. A disruption to supplies there could mean increased demand for U.S. supplies.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc34431bb886"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">US wheat</a></span> for May delivery dipped 0.27 cents, or 0.06%, to trade at $4.9713 a bushel as ample global supplies and indications of reduced demand for U.S. wheat continued to weigh.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the May wheat contract fell to $4.9500 a bushel, the lowest level since February 3, before ending at $4.9720, down 6.4 cents, or 1.29%.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the Chicago Board of Trade, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc34431bb9d0"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">US corn</a></span> for May delivery inched up 1.48 cents, or 0.38%, to trade at $3.8588 a bushel.</p>
<p>US corn for May delivery shed 1.6 cents, or 0.45%, on Wednesday to close at $3.8360, after touching a low of $3.7940, a level not seen since February 3, as losses in wheat weighed.</p>
<p>Wheat and corn prices are linked because both can be used as animal feed.</p>
<p>Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, government figures show. Wheat was fourth, behind hay.</p>

<p></p><p>UK Prime Minister Johnson is neither dead in a ditch as he said he would prefer to be than request an extension of Brexit, nor will the UK leave the EU at the end of the month. Yesterday's vote rejected the attempt to fast-track the legislation needed to support the divorce agreement. It all but ensures that such a delay will be forthcoming. The question now is whether a new timetable will be agreed up or whether efforts will be made to hold an election.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the capital markets are mostly little changed as investors lack near-term conviction. Asia Pacific equities were narrowly mixed, and the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/msci-world-stock"" id=""5fc34acfc0497"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""941023"">MSCI</a></span> benchmark was weighed down by losses in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea. Note that Taiwan's benchmark hit a nearly 20-year high yesterday, before pulling back today. Japanese, Indian, and Australian markets edged higher. Bourses in Europe were slightly lower, and US shares were also trading a bit heavier. Benchmark 10-year bond yields are 2-4 bp lower, though the Antipodean bond yields shed 5-6 bp. The foreign exchange market is calm, with most of the major currencies not much more than +/- 0.15% and emerging market currencies in a slightly wider range. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc34acfc0866"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">Gold</a></span> remains in a narrow range below $1500, and December <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc34acfc0990"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">WTI</a></span> is inside yesterday's range, straddling $54 a barrel.</p><p></p>
<p><strong>Asia Pacific</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Financial Times reports that plans are emerging whereby Lam, Hong Kong's Chief Executive, steps down, which apparently she has wanted to do for some time. </strong>The report suggests that if she is allowed to resign, it might not take place until March. .Her term extends to 2022. It is unclear what a resignation then would achieve. The demonstrators have sought her resignation, but waiting four-five months will likely have little bearing on the protests. It is not even clear that if the transition were to happen sooner, it would provide closure and end the demonstrations. The press report (citing ""people said"") identified two potential candidates, a former head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and a former finance and chief secretary.</p>
<p><strong>The US-China trade conflict has been eclipsed by other developments, but the challenge remains</strong>. Both sides are claiming progress, though we continue to note that no date has been set for the resumption of face-to-face talks that are supposed to lead to a signed deal on the sidelines of next month's APEC meeting. China announced it granted its third round of waivers of the retaliatory tariffs to buy as much as 10 mln tons of US soy, which is double the earlier rounds. While many observers see such steps as cooperative, we suspect it shows what could happen without an agreement--opportunistic buying of American soy not to do US farmers any favors but to meet the domestic shortage. That said, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34acfc0aa9"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">US soybeans</a></span> are at trading near four-month highs, and Chinese importers may wait for prices to soften before placing new orders.</p>
<p></p><p><strong>The dollar slipped to a six-day low against the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-jpy"" id=""5fc34acfc0bb6"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""3"">Japanese yen</a></span> near JPY108.25. </strong>The session low has so far been recorded in the Tokyo session, and this may discourage foreign participants from taking the dollar higher if Japanese accounts are sellers. A break of JPY108, which houses the 20-day moving average and the (38.2%) retracement of this month's rally, is necessary to confirm our suspicions that the market is giving up on the JPY109 area. <strong>The Australian dollar is trading at a three-day low as the upside momentum has faded, and corrective pressures have come to the fore. Initial support is pegged near $0;6820 and then $0.6800. </strong>A close above $0.6865 would lift the tone. The dollar remains in narrow ranges against the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-cny"" id=""5fc34acfc0ca5"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""2111"">Chinese yuan</a></span>, and the implied one-month volatility has fallen to levels (~4%) not seen since Beijing allowed the greenback to rise above CNY7.0.</p><p></p>
<p><strong>Europe</strong></p>
<p><strong>The elation that Prime Minister Johnson felt when the House of Commons supported the broad principles of his agreement (322-299) lasted less than 30 minutes.</strong> Parliament quickly rebuffed his attempt to push the necessary legislation through without much debate (322-308). This seems to ensure that the October 31 deadline cannot be met. The EU will not consider the request for a three-month extension. EU President Tusk said that the EU would never force a no-deal exit on the UK. However, Johnson has threatened to force snap elections if there was such a delay and withdraw the bill from consideration. It is possible that, given the first vote, that theoretically, the UK would be ready to leave in November, but an election gambit would force a longer extension. That said, some of the Labour MPs that voted in favor of Johnson's plan in principle (first vote) cautioned that its vote was tactical so that Johnson's plan can be amended and their support cannot be taken for granted going forward.</p>
<p><strong>The ECB meets tomorrow. </strong>It will be Draghi's last meeting. Given the package of measures announced last month, it is unreasonable to expect new initiatives. One key issue that remains unresolved, though, is about the self-imposed caps on holdings. Don't expect Draghi to address the issue, but our understanding is that it is not very pressing now and will not be well into next year. The press conference will likely focus on retrospection and the challenges that Lagarde faces. A few hours before the ECB announcement, the October flash PMI will be reported. A small increase is expected.</p>
<p><strong>As the cessation of Turkish hostilities in Syria was coming to an end, an agreement with Russia was announced to create a buffer zone in northern Syria that includes joint patrols and coordinated action with Syria's regular forces to push out the remaining Kurdish fighters. </strong>Meanwhile, Turkey's central bank meets tomorrow, and many look for another 100 bp rate cut that will bring the one-week repo rate to 15.5%. Separately, reports suggest that the government may be looking to get another large transfer from the central bank based on unrealized gains in its revaluation account (accrual changes in gold and fx holdings). Currently, tapping the revaluation account is prohibited and requires legislative action to change it. Many observers focus on Turkey's hard currency debt, but in Q1 20, an estimated TRY75 bln of local debt is coming due.</p>
<p></p><p><strong>The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/eur-usd"" id=""5fc34acfc0dad"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""1"">euro</a></span> is near a four-day low around $1.1115 after peaking just shy of $1.1180 on Monday, a two-month high. </strong>While the nearly 635 mln euro option struck at $1.1150 that expires today does not seem relevant, the roughly 960 mln option at $1.11 that also expires today may be challenged. We see a band of support extending to $1.1085. Intraday resistance is seen near $1.1130. <strong>Sterling has also eased to a four-day low near $1.2840. </strong>The low was set in Asia. Nearby support is seen around $1.2820, and a break opens the door to as much as another cent pullback. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/gbp-usd"" id=""5fc34acfc0eb1"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""2"">Cable</a></span> should be capped in front of $1.29 pending new developments.</p><p></p>
<p><strong>America</strong></p>
<p></p><p><strong>With the quiet period ahead of next week's FOMC meeting and a light economic schedule today, before tomorrow's <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/durable-goods-orders-86"" id=""5fc34acfc1409"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""86"">durable goods orders</a></span>, flash PMI, and new home sales tomorrow, the market is in need of trading incentives today</strong>. The focus may be on corporate earnings. Around 20% of the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/us-spx-500"" id=""5fc34acfc0fbf"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""166"">S&amp;P 500</a></span> report this week. Companies that disappoint are being punished, but what is concerning is that even many companies that meet or exceed the guided expectations are lowering the outlook for next year.</p><p></p>
<p><strong>The violent demonstrations have put Chile back on many investors' radar screens. </strong>The government has announced some reforms to help blunt the impact of the higher administered prices and taxes, like a 20% increase in the guaranteed pensions and a boost to the minimum guaranteed income. Late today, the central bank is expected to cut the overnight target rate to 1.75% from 2.0%. The rate has been reduced twice since May, and both moves were 50 bp. Recall that the central bank had hiked rates by 25 bp in January before the easing cycle began. Brail's Senate is expected to pass the pension reform today after the bill was pulled yesterday to consider the impact of an amendment. The dollar fell 1.1% yesterday against the Brazilian real to reach its lowest level (almost BRL4.06) in three weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Reports indicate that API estimated US oil reserves rose 4.45 mln barrels last week. </strong>If a build is confirmed by the EIA today, it would be the sixth weekly accumulation and the longest streak since last September-November, when the oil build stretched for 10 weeks. Separately, OPEC is reportedly considering deeper output cuts amid projections of weaker demand. Bloomberg reports that more supertankers are headed for China than seen in the past couple of years. Looking downstream, this may signal that Chinese refiners are set to ramp up output.</p>
<p></p><p><strong>The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/us-dollar-index"" id=""5fc34acfc10c7"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8827"">US dollar</a></span> fell to three-month lows yesterday as the market took in stride the loss of the Liberal majority in Canada's parliament in Monday's election. </strong>Macro policy is unlikely to be impacted very much. The US dollar is straddling the CAD1.3100 area. We anticipate that near-term greenback low has been approached. Scope for corrective upticks extends into the CAD1.3175-CAD1.3200. <strong>The dollar may have formed a bullish hammer candlestick against the Mexican peso yesterday. </strong>Recall that greenback had fallen for eight consecutive sessions coming into this week's activity. It has traded higher Monday and Tuesday and is seeing some mild follow-through gains today. Initial resistance is seen near MXN19.20, but we see near-term potential toward MXN19.26.</p><p></p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

As of Sunday, the corn harvest was 5% picked and 2020 so far has proved to this is not your average run of the mill harvest or hurricane season.

Weather was generally good to for harvest activity last week in many key growing areas. While in parts of the country might still have corn and soybean to harvest, statistically, the season is over. Corn and soybeans hit a 4-year high as forecast rainfall missed parts of Brazil and forecasts for scattered precipitation in parts of Argentina and Brazil will not be enough to break through the drought. There are whispers of more corn sales to the unknown, while commercials and funds rollout of December to March contracts, with the funds net-long and the commercials net-short. I have already witnessed a variety of speculation longs for 2021 in corn and soybeans to date.

Ethanol has been a big source of demand for domestic corn, even though sharply curbed by global fuel consumption. In recent weeks Reuters says output has chipped away at its deficit in prior years. However, the resurgence of Covid and increasing restrictions, especially before the holiday season, threaten to halt a comeback in fuel demand before it can ramp up.

As Venezuela’s regime has recently arrested oil workers or retired oil workers who have dared to expose the corruption and mismanagement at its state oil firm PDVSA and its dire financial, operational, and working conditions. In a country holding the world’s biggest oil reserves, and they cannot keep a refinery running? Sounds like that country in Seattle, Chaz. Nicolas MADuro is clinging to power in this once rich and vast land of opportunity. The socialist moved in and now a country with enterprising dreams is now called a socialist regime and I pray to God it will never the word regime will never be applied to the United States of America.

    </div>
        <p>Investing.com - U.S. corn rose for the fifth consecutive session on Thursday to trade at the highest level in more than two months, as prices were boosted by bullish chart signals.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc34538ddc46"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">US corn</a></span> for May delivery touched an intraday peak of $3.9700 a bushel, the most since January 13, before trading at $3.9638 during U.S. morning hours, up 0.97 cents, or 0.25%.</p>
<p>A day earlier, US corn for May delivery inched up 1.6 cents, or 0.45%, to end at $3.9500.</p>
<p>Corn is up more than 5% in the four sessions leading up to Thursday, as a bout of technical buying kicked in after futures broke above key moving-averages.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc34538ddfa8"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">US wheat</a></span> for May delivery tacked on 4.88 cents, or 0.94%, to trade at $5.2388 a bushel.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, wheat declined 4.4 cents, or 0.86%, to settle at $5.1900 amid easing concerns over winter-wheat crop conditions in the U.S.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Oklahoma winter wheat was rated 44% good to excellent as of last week, up from 40% in the previous week, while Texas winter wheat improved by 4% to 55%.</p>
<p>In Kansas, the top wheat-producing state, the wheat crop was rated 41% good to excellent, unchanged from the preceding week.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the Chicago Board of Trade, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34538de219"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">US soybeans</a></span> for May delivery advanced 1.38 cents, or 0.14%, to trade at $9.8038 a bushel. US soybeans for May delivery dipped 3.0 cents, or 0.31%, on Wednesday to close at $9.7860.</p>
<p>Optimism over the outlook for supplies in Brazil and Argentina combined with indications over a slowdown in demand for U.S. soybeans have weighed on prices in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Brazil and Argentina are major soybean exporters and compete with the U.S. for business on the global market. Large South American crop prospects could weigh on demand for U.S. supplies.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/us-dollar-index"" id=""5fc34538de313"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8827"">U.S. dollar index</a></span>, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.7% to 96.40 early on Thursday.</p>
<p>A weaker dollar increases the appeal of U.S. crops to overseas buyers and makes commodities more attractive as an alternative investment.</p>
<p>The greenback remained under pressure as a recent soft patch of U.S. economic data added to uncertainty over the timing of a future interest rate hike.</p>
<p>Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, government figures show. Wheat was fourth, behind hay.</p>

The majority of those cases were mainland China and Hong Kong. No cases of SARS have been reported worldwide since 2004. More cases and more fatalities have been realized  by influenza and did not receive the same coverage or sensationalism as we see in this vote harvesting time. Is this just another chapter of history repeating itself with just a little different spin, like the name? And at the end of the day it will come out the wash the same.   </p><p></p>

        <p></p><p>Investing.com -- It's payrolls day, and hiring in the U.S. economy is expected to have rebounded in November from October's dip due to the end of the strike at General Motors (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/gen-motors"" id=""5fc350193c84e"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""239"">GM</a></span>). Elsewhere, OPEC and its allies are set to sign off on a largely symbolic cut in output through March 2021, while Saudi Aramco is now the world's most valuable company after completing its $25.6 billion IPO. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, 6th December.</p><p></p>
<p><strong>1. Payrolls Day</strong></p>
<p></p><p>The Commerce Department will release its monthly survey of the U.S. labor market, the most closely-watched update on the health of the U.S. economy, at 8:30 AM (1330 GMT). The headline <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/nonfarm-payrolls-227"" id=""5fc350193e177"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""227"">nonfarm payrolls</a></span> number is expected to have picked up to 186,000 from a four-month low of 128,000 in October, although the monthly fluctuation is somewhat distorted by the end of the strike at General Motors (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/gen-motors"" id=""5fc350193cccb"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""239"">GM</a></span>).</p><p></p>
<p>In a still-tight labor market, arguably the more important number will be average hourly earnings growth, which have dipped slightly to an annual rate of 3.0% for the last two months. They’re expected to stay at that rate. Likewise, average weekly hours worked are expected to stay at 34.0.</p>
<p></p><p>The numbers come after a much weaker-than-expected report on private-sector payrolls from ADP (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/auto-data-process"" id=""5fc350193ce2b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""9019"">ADP</a></span>) earlier in the week.</p><p></p>
<p><strong>2. OPEC+ to sign off on a sort of production cut</strong></p>
<p></p><p>The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said after a marathon session of haggling between its members that it wants to take another 500,000 barrels a day of production off world markets through March 2020. The cut is largely symbolic because OPEC is already producing less than the agreed ceiling under the existing deal on output restraint. </p><p></p>
<p></p><p>Under the proposal, OPEC countries would cut their output by 395,000 barrels a day, while its allies led by Russia would cut another 105,000 barrels a day. There is, however, a big loophole: Russia’s production of gas condensate, estimated at 700,000 barrels a day next year, won’t be included in the calculations. Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, is already producing well below its output ceiling, meaning that the actual outcome for markets will depend on the behavior of countries like Iraq and Nigeria, who have repeatedly breached their quotas in recent months.</p><p></p>
<p>The measures, which need to be ratified by a meeting that is still in progress, are intended to stop a fresh glut forming on world markets, but analysts are skeptical that what’s been announced will be enough. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc350193d727"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">Crude oil</a></span> traders, who have pushed prices nearly 4% higher this week in anticipation of deeper output cuts, have decided to hold fire until they see more details.</p>
<p>(<em>CORRECTION: An initial version of this article incorrectly reported the timeframe for the cuts</em>)</p>
<p><strong>3. Stocks set to open higher on Chinese tariff waiver</strong></p>
<p></p><p>U.S. stock markets are set to open higher Friday, encouraged by a Chinese government decision to waive import tariffs on U.S. pork and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc350193d872"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span>. Beijing had imposed a 25% tariff on both in response to U.S. tariff increases earlier in the year.</p><p></p>

<p></p><p>Stocks to watch this morning include <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/zoom-video-communications-earnings"" id=""5fc350193e25f"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""erl"" data-pairid=""1127188"">Zoom Video</a></span>, which fell sharply in after-hours trading after its outlook failed to match Wall Street’s ambitious expectations. By contrast, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/crowdstrike-holdings-inc-earnings"" id=""5fc350193e309"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""erl"" data-pairid=""1131557"">Crowdstrike</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/docusign-inc-earnings"" id=""5fc350193e3b0"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""erl"" data-pairid=""1073599"">DocuSign</a></span> both popped higher after their earnings after the bell on Thursday.</p><p></p>
<p><strong>4. The world's most valuable company</strong></p>
<p>Saudi Aramco finally broke the record for the world’s largest-ever initial public offering, raising the equivalent of $25.6 billion through the sale of a 1.5% stake.</p>
<p>The deal, which was priced at the top end of the bookbuilding range of 30 to 32 Saudi riyals, valued the company at some $1.7 trillion. While that makes Aramco officially the world’s most valuable company, it’s some 15% less than the valuation the kingdom had initially hoped for.</p>
<p>The sale ultimately reflects the seller’s failure to attract institutional buyers from developed capital markets due to its refusal to compromise on core concerns around governance. Trading on the Saudi exchange is due to begin next week.</p>
<p></p><p><strong>5. Uber's report details extent of safety flaws</strong></p><p></p>
<p>Uber (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/uber-technologies-inc"" id=""5fc350193dd5b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""1115848"">UBER</a></span>) said it had fielded nearly 6,000 reports of sexual abuse by its drivers in the U.S. in the past two years, confirming one of the most serious fears about its governance.</p>
<p>The report, which was commissioned by the company itself in the wake of founder Travis Kalanick’s departure as CEO, comes less than two weeks after the city of London said it would suspend the company’s license to operate because of repeated failures in monitoring drivers.</p>
<p>There were 515 incidents of rape or attempted rape in 2018 alone - almost 10 a week - the report said.</p>
<p>The numbers are still small in relation to the 2.3 billion rides booked by Uber (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/uber-technologies-inc"" id=""5fc350193de9f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""1115848"">UBER</a></span>) in the two years under examination.

        <p>Investing.com - U.S. wheat futures extended losses from the previous session to hit a four-week low on Tuesday, after agricultural meteorologists forecast further rains in key U.S. wheat-growing states.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc345a87cc5d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">US wheat</a></span> for May delivery hit a session low of $4.9788 a bushel, the weakest level since March 16, before trading at $4.9938 during U.S. morning hours, down 3.62 cents, or 0.72%.</p>
<p>A day earlier, wheat plunged 24.2 cents, or 4.61%, to settle at $5.0220, as updated weather models forecast much-needed rains in key U.S. wheat-growing states.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture said Monday that the U.S. winter wheat crop was rated 42% good to excellent as of April 12, down from 44% in the preceding week.</p>
<p>Approximately 34% of the crop was in good to excellent condition in the same week a year earlier.</p>
<p>The agency also said that 17% of the spring wheat crop was planted as of last week, compared to just 5% in the same week a year earlier and below the five-year average of 11% for this time of year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc345a87cf0c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">US corn</a></span> for May delivery slumped 0.62 cents, or 0.17%, to trade at $3.7038 a bushel. Prices touched a daily low of $3.7020, a level not seen since March 18.</p>
<p>According to the USDA, 2% of the corn crop was planted as of last week. The five-year average for this time of year is 5%.</p>
<p>Corn declined 6.4 cent, or 1.72%, on Monday to end at $3.7040 amid indications of ample supplies.</p>
<p>The USDA said last week that U.S. corn inventories at the end of the 2014-15 season in August will total 1.827 billion bushels, up from a previous estimate of 1.777 billion bushels.</p>

On Monday, soybean prices shed 2.6 cents, or 0.29%, to close at $9.4860.</p>
<p>Prices of the oilseed touched a six-month low of $9.4440 on April 10 as optimism over the outlook for supplies in South America and weak demand for U.S. supplies drove down prices.</p>
<p>Last week, the USDA forecast global soybean ending stocks at 89.6 million tons, up from 89.5 million tons estimated last month, due to a record crop in Brazil.</p>
<p>Brazil and Argentina are major soybean exporters and compete with the U.S. for business on the global market. Large South American crop prospects could weigh on demand for U.S. supplies.</p>

<p><strong>We thought that the “process of reversing” would not be a “V” shaped top</strong>...we expected BTD buying to give the market a significant boost after the first leg down...but so far the “bounce” has been modest and Friday’s break below the August lows may temper the apparently widely held belief that,<em> “Stocks only go up.”</em></p>

    </div>
        <p>(Bloomberg) -- The outlook for commodities is bullish, according to <span itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Corporation""><span itemprop=""name""> Citigroup </span></span> Inc (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/citigroup"" id=""5fc34fb01930a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""241"">C</a></span>)., which expects raw materials to be supported by a confluence of positive factors including the agreement of a trade deal between Washington and Beijing, improved demand from China, and a weaker dollar.</p>
<p>The bank’s base case is that the U.S. and China will agree to end their protracted trade fight by end-June, paving the way for tariffs to be lifted, analysts including Ed Morse said in a report. A deal between the two economies is now “on course” for the end of the second quarter, the bank said.</p>
<p>Raw materials have advanced in 2019 aided by gains in energy and metals, with the latest leg up this week driven by the U.S. decision not to extend sanctions waivers for buyers of Iranian crude. At the same time, the U.S. and China have stepped up the pace of diplomacy to try to resolve their trade squabble, with speculation that an agreement may come next month. A resolution would benefit demand for commodities from <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34fb019560"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span> to pork.</p>
<p>“Partly as agreed during the trade talks, China is expected to boost purchases of energy and agricultural products from the U.S. in the months and years ahead,” the bank said. The current period will be “be another strong quarter for commodities,” and raw materials are also “looking up” into the third quarter and potentially to year-end, it said.</p>
<p>Global growth is seen at 2.8 percent this year and 2.9 percent in 2020, according to the bank, which described that outlook as “still reasonable.” It added: “While a constructive global economic outlook is good for commodities, China being a key engine for global growth would be a further positive.”</p>
<p>Iron Ore</p>
<p>In addition to the supportive macro and trade backdrop, Citigroup was positive on commodities that have been hit by supply crunches, especially <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/iron-ore-62-cfr-futures"" id=""5fc34fb01961c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""961729"">iron ore</a></span>. The steelmaking raw material has surged this year following mine suspensions in Brazil and disruptions to Australian output from a cyclone.</p>
<p>The bank also warned that the spread of African swine fever in China may end up contaminating as much as a quarter of the country’s vast herd, or up to 200 million pigs. That would tighten global protein supplies and the U.S. lean hog market as the mainland stepped up imports of pork, beef and poultry, it said.</p>

        <p>Investing.com - U.S. wheat futures rallied for the third straight session on Monday to trade close to a seven-week high as a lack of rainfall in the U.S. grain belt fuelled concerns over the health of the winter-wheat crop.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc345767f2bf"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">US wheat</a></span> for May delivery tacked on 6.97 cents, or 1.3%, to trade at $5.4338 a bushel during U.S. morning hours.</p>
<p>On Thursday, wheat touched $5.4420, the most since February 17. There was no settlement in grain futures on Friday as markets were closed for the start of the Easter holiday.</p>
<p>The May wheat contract rallied 21.76 cents, or 5.15%, last week, as concerns over the health of the winter-wheat crop supported prices.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc345767f5e9"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">US corn</a></span> for May delivery inched up 1.93 cents, or 0.5%, to trade at $3.8913 a bushel.</p>
<p>Gains were likely to remain limited amid indications of ample supplies. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said last week that U.S. corn inventories on March 1 totaled 7.745 billion bushels, 11% higher than last year.</p>
<p>The agency also projected U.S. farmers would plant 89.199 million acres with corn in 2015, surpassing forecasts for 88.735 million but down from 90.597 million in 2014.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the Chicago Board of Trade, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc345767f74c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">US soybeans</a></span> for May delivery added 1.63 cents, or 0.16%, to trade at $9.8763 a bushel.</p>
<p>According to the USDA, domestic soybean stocks at the start of March totaled 1.334 billion bushels, 34% higher than last year. The agency also said that growers in the U.S. will sow 84.635 million acres of soybeans this year, up 1.1% from a year earlier.</p>
<p>Later in the day, the USDA will release the first national planting progress report of the season.</p>
<p>Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, government figures show. Wheat was fourth, behind hay.</p>

<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-cnh"" id=""5fc34b84530fc"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""961728"">USD/CNH</a></span> rejected the leg higher last week. Technically, one could weave a convincing tale that the weekly candles suggest a limited upside from here. Still, the market is mostly at the mercy of trade talk headline risk, and the frequency of these updates should pick up this week ahead of December 15, thought to be the line in the sand for the U.S. to impose more tariffs.</p>
<p>Last week provided a not so subtle reminder that when it comes to trade wars, it’s never over till it’s over. But the yuan rallying into week's end on the back of expectations that a deal will happen sooner or later did reinforce our argument that the markets will continue to price in peak tariffs and a possible tariff rollback.</p>
<p>USDCNH bounced higher at today's open on the weaker CNY <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/trade-balance-(usd)-466"" id=""5fc34b84549fc"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""466"">export data</a></span>. But traders might use that opportunity to re-engage yuan longs on the back of improved trade talk sentiment. Mainly, Mnuchin’s critical inference to the “artificial” deadline; this offers up a higher probability that the December 15 tariffs will be deferred.</p>
<p>This view should also buttress ASEAN currency sentiment.</p>
<p> <em>Price action alone suggests the markets are effectively pricing in a 75% chance of a delay in duty and maybe a 25% chance of a tariff reversal. So, there is still considerable room for the yuan to rally if the September rollback is put into effect, based on the above assumptions. </em></p>
<h3><strong>View from the street </strong></h3>
<p>But frankly if pressed for a cross-asset view, there’s a standard feeling on the street that's building around year-end de-risking and profit-taking. Mind you I find this a bit surprising in the wake of the robust U.S. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/nonfarm-payrolls-227"" id=""5fc34b8454b2b"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""227"">jobs data</a></span>, but even on that front, common sense seems to prevail, and traders are opting not to chase a possible one-off blockbuster report.</p>
<p>I think this is a function of the time of year where traders are looking to pare not add risk so they could be more prone to book profits on risk upticks.</p>
<p>All the while trade headlines and bond yields continue to act as the primary rudders for global risk and asset rotation. </p>
<h2><strong>Asia Open</strong> </h2>
<h3><strong>Nothing like a blockbuster NFP to send the bears scurrying</strong></h3><p></p>
<p></p><p>Equities were stronger Friday, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/us-spx-500"" id=""5fc34b84535fd"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""166"">S&amp;P 500</a></span> up 0.9%, and U.S. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/rates-bonds/u.s.-10-year-bond-yield"" id=""5fc34b84536d3"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""23705"">10-year</a></span> Treasury yields rose 3bps to 1.84%. Despite a weak <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/adp-nonfarm-employment-change-1"" id=""5fc34b8454c4b"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1"">ADP read</a></span> earlier in the week, U.S. payrolls for November were much stronger than expected, rising 266k with upward revisions. European stocks were also stronger. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc34b84537ed"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">Gold</a></span> fell 1%, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc34b84538f9"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">oil</a></span> rose 1.3%.</p><p></p>
<p>U.S. job gains roared back in November as <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/unemployment-rate-300"" id=""5fc34b8454d67"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""300"">unemployment</a></span> matched a fresh half-century low and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/average-hourly-earnings-8"" id=""5fc34b8454e74"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""8"">wages</a></span> topped estimates, giving the Federal Reserve more reason to <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/central-banks/fed-rate-monitor"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""frl"">hold interest rates steady</a></span> after three straight cuts. And it should add to policymakers' confidence that consumer spending will be able to toe the line amidst the soft patch in business investment.</p>
<p>While the Treasury sell-off did stall around 1.85% yield, but undoubtedly the strength of the jobs number is going to make people think twice about stepping up to the plate. Last week's NFP could support the notion that the world is looking for a near-term rebound in the U.S. and the global economy. Even if you don't believe that narrative while thinking, we are merely in the calm between two storms, its challenging to critique this NFP report in any other light than to describe it as excellent if not a total blockbuster. At a minimum, it will push back calls for Fed rate cuts further along the curve, but importantly for year-end sentiment, it could provide a significant buffer to get markets across the finish line.</p>
<p><em>China trade data</em></p>
<p>Drawing attention to the importance of the trade negotiations for both China and market sentiment, at the open the market is experiencing a bit of a hangover from the weekend release of China's sagging export data, which was a casualty again of the protracted trade war with the U.S. coming home to roost. </p>
<p><em>Trade talk calm</em></p>
<p>But supporting risk sentiment is the positive shift in the tides of trade war. U.S. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin continues to suggest the talks are on track, and the ""artificial"" deadline does not bind the U.S. While in a positive gesture, China's ministry of finance said it would waive import tariffs for some <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34b8453a12"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/lean-hogs"" id=""5fc34b8453b30"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8913"">pork</a></span> shipments from the United States </p>
<p>So, the market continues to price in peak tariff and a probable rollback of the last tranche of tariffs imposed in September. However, traders then turn a blind eye to the U.S. passage of Hong Kong and Xinjiang bills, which could eventually lead to phase 2 purgatory.  </p>
<p><em>UK Elections</em></p>
<p>After weeks of waiting and years in the making, this week will mark the third UK <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/u.k.-general-election-1709"" id=""5fc34b845536c"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1709"">general election</a></span> in the last five years. While not in the same league as Italian politics as far as frequency of elections, that<strong>'</strong>s still the highest number of elections held in the UK over any five year period since the early 1970s. But the outcome will be the most significant economically and politically, inspiring the cleanest breaks between the past, present and future in the storied history of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p><em>FOMC </em></p>
<p>Friday's stellar employment report should add to policymakers' confidence that <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/real-consumer-spending-914"" id=""5fc34b845583e"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""914"">consumer spending</a></span> will be able to hold the line amidst the soft patch in business investment. Thus, Chair Powell could reiterate his recent remarks, which indicate that the Committee sees policy in the right place barring a ""material reassessment"" to the outlook. In this light, we could also expect Powell echoes a similar view from October, that while the bar to cutting rates is high, the bar for hiking is even higher as prudence would suggest the FOMC fade the strength in the massive jobs report. After all, it's seldom wise to place too much emphasis on possible one-off noisy jobs reports especially when the data is subject to significant revisions.</p>
<p></p><h2><strong>Oil markets</strong></h2>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc34b8453c37"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">Crude oil</a></span> prices spiked on comments from the Saudi Oil minister clarifying how he interprets the commitments from members of OPEC to cut production. He states that with full compliance, the total production cut would be 2.1mn bbls, which is 900k more than the current agreement, and more than the original headline, which said the cuts would total 500k. This is made up of full compliance plus announced cuts plus a 400k bbl voluntary cut by the Saudis.</p>
<p>The news was perceived bullish for oil prices after the Saudi surprise. Saudi Arabia is trying to reset market expectations. Still, a little bit of fact-checking suggests the informal commitment counts to Saudi production at 9.75 million barrels per day, which is not much below average January-October 2019 output of 9.81 million barrels per day.</p>
<p>But it would appear the market is giving the new Saudi energy minister Abdulaziz bin Salman the benefit of the doubt that he will be able to improve compliance, particularly from Iraq and Russia. At this week's open, oil remains supported by the trifecta of positives, a blockbuster NFP given rise to the global reflation trade, trade talk olive branches filling the headlines, and hopes for improved OPEC compliance.  </p>
<h2><strong>Gold markets </strong></h2><p></p>
<p>Nonfarm payrolls rose 266,000 vs. a consensus 180,000 increase; U.S. job growth increased by the most in 10 months. The reaction in the financial markets was quick and robust.</p>
<p>The yields on the U.S. 10- year Treasury moved up to 1.86% from 1.79% previously, and the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/us-dollar-index"" id=""5fc34b8453d40"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8827"">DXY Index</a></span> moved up to 97.84 from 97.38 previously, and the e-minis galloped 30 points higher. All of which weighed on gold, but it was the frothy equity market that played the prime roll in undercutting gold prices.</p>
<p>The surge in equity markets is the most evident barometer of “risk-on” investor appetite, which throttled potential buyers in gold and prompted selling. In addition, some indications of progress on the trade front between China and the U.S. were also limiting gold upside ambitions before the data.</p>
<p>Expectations were a bit too tepid, and the final employment report of the decade was a blowout suggesting the U.S. economy is in good shape entering 2020</p>
<p><em>Gold is likely to stay on the defensive near-term.</em></p>
<p>It appears that employment growth may be holding up a bit more strongly than it previously appeared, which should have the effect of pushing out rate cut expectations further along the U.S. curve, and bearish for gold. </p>
<p>Trade issues have also shifted to more negative for gold. The U.S. administration said trade talks with China were “moving right along,” according to Reuters. And China continues to offer olive branches but reducing tariffs on U.S. agricultural imports.</p>
<p></p><h2><strong>Currency markets </strong></h2><p></p>
<p><em>The euro </em></p>
<p>While I gave up forecasting NFP decades ago, given that its a noisy data set open to constant revisions, but I'm 100% sure Friday's blockbuster number is outright dollar-positive versus the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/eur-usd"" id=""5fc34b8453e57"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""1"">euro</a></span> where the EU data continues to run wishy-washy.</p>
<p><em>The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/gbp-usd"" id=""5fc34b8453f63"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""2"">pound</a></span> </em></p>
<p>PM Johnson’s mandate is clear as a bell: leave the EU in January. And he’s hoping that this week’s election will break the Parliamentary deadlock on Brexit. If polls are correct, PM Johnson’s gamble could pay off. </p>
<p>As things sit at the time of writing, the Tories hold a 10-15-point lead over Labour, which should translate into a resounding majority if the number holds up into election day. The reason why I say “IF"" is that Theresa May had a similar lead with around a week to go, and we know how that story ended. </p>
<p>No two ways about it, early-week polls will be critical for sentiment, as it could give traders a heads-up if the numbers are trending in a similar direction to 2017. Last-minute sentiment swings could make this one of the most unpredictable events in some time, but it’s also without question one of the most critical events in the UK’s storied history.</p>
<p><em>The Malaysia ringgit </em></p>
<p>Friday was the second day of broadening EM Asia rally in FX. (<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-myr"" id=""5fc34b845405b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""2168"">MYR</a></span>, CNH, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-sgd"" id=""5fc34b845415a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""42"">SGD</a></span>, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-idr"" id=""5fc34b845424f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""2138"">IDR</a></span> saw positive demand even the beleaguered <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-krw"" id=""5fc34b8454342"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""650"">KRW</a></span> managed to stop the week-long bloodletting.</p>
<p>The ringgit remains supported by higher oil prices, a globally reflating economy, and definite trade talk overtones. However, the market could open on a more somber tone in the wake of China's trade data. </p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

We start the week with cooler-than-normal temperatures and on Turn-Around Tuesday, we will see the mercury rising and possibly hit 90 degrees by Wednesday in most of the Corn Belt with intermediate rains. This should be conducive to a healthy strong crop, as we get the Crop Progress data later today. July corn is currently trading at 328 ½ which is 1 and a ½ of a cent lower. The trading range has been 328-330.</p>

The plant has been idle since May, as the coronavirus outbreak hampered fuel ethanol demand. While fuel ethanol is seeing some recovery, it is still 20-30% where it was last year. Fuel ethanol producers have seen little to no margins for some time, forcing many to idle or cut production. Ethanol is used as a gasoline blendstock, in pharmaceuticals, such as hand sanitizers and in food and beverage, such as in vodka. There has been smaller-than-usual ethanol commodity participation as well. There were no trades posted in the overnight electronic session. The July contract settled at 1.198 and is currently showing 1 bid @ 1.127 and 1 offer @ 1.240 with Open Interest at 72 contracts.</p>

This also has weakened the stock market. Despite production cuts, the market is twitching with an eerie feeling over the demand outlook, given the prospect of some states retreating on their previous plans to ease lockdowns. July crude is currently trading around $35.20, or around 3% lower. The trading range has been $34.36-36.12.</p>
<p>The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/natural-gas"" id=""5fc352403d25c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8862"">natural gas</a></span> market continues a steady-to-lower pattern, with continued weakness, given the global glut, among other fundamentals we have discussed. We expect to see new selling, unless there is a spike in prices, or the current downtrend bottoms out. Some analysts are predicting this is the next commodity to go into negative territory and most likely will not recover as quickly as crude oil has. In the overnight electronic session the July natural gas is currently trading at $1.680 per mmBtu, down nearly 3%. The range has been 1.714-1.761.</p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- China intends to announce this month the first batch of U.S. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34f90e6c03"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybean</a></span> purchases where most, if not all, will be destined for state reserves, according to government officials.</p>
<p>The final decision will be made by the State Council or cabinet, said the people, who declined to be identified as the matter is confidential. Details to be decided include whether the volume should be 5 million tons or 8 million tons, if commercial companies should buy a further 2 million tons and be reimbursed for the 25 percent tariffs, the people said.</p>
<p>The decision comes just over a week after U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping pledged during the G20 meeting in Argentina to resolve the trade tensions that have disrupted global commodity flows. The resumption of U.S. soybean purchases will provide some relief to American farmers who have seen exports to the world’s biggest consumer plummet and domestic inventories pile up.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance officials led a meeting last week to discuss the resumption of American imports, the people said. It remains unclear whether the purchases will be made this month and if the shipments will be taxed first and reimbursed later, or will follow a cut in tariffs, they said. China’s commerce ministry and the finance ministry have not replied to faxes seeking comments.</p>

The facts are clear cut they will have more orders to restock their state-run stockpiles sold at auction earlier, and they do not want a population that is hungry.

<p>A powerful reversal in risk today in European trade helped turn futures positive as markets ignored the social unrest in the US and focused instead on news that China may continue to buy <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34ccd69acb"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">US soybeans</a></span>.</p>
<p>As we noted yesterday, the only thing that seems to derail this market is the prospect of further US-China tensions. Not the specter of civil unrest in every major US city. Not the possibility of 20% of US small-businesses closing their doors forever. Not even the disturbing trend of rising COVID-19 infections in such key states as Texas have had any impact on the relentless rally in equities.</p>
<p>Stock traders have been happy to ignore every piece of bad news, as long as the Fed spigot remains open and the war of words between Beijing and Washington DC does not turn into further tariffs and sanctions. Therefore, today’s story in Global Times that China continues to purchase US soybeans in line with market rules, unaffected by external factors, helped spark a buying frenzy at the start of European trade that pushed indices higher by nearly 1% after being down as much as -0.5% in early Asian hours.</p>
<p>In FX, the risk flows also pressed forward with the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/usdollar"" id=""5fc34ccd69b8e"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""942611"">buck</a></span> lower across the board and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/eur-usd"" id=""5fc34ccd69c54"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""1"">EUR/USD</a></span> up for the fourth straight day as the pair approached the key $1.1200 hurdle. We have noted before that the euro appears to have turned the corner after an announcement of a massive fiscal stimulus fund pushed by Germany and France. But longs need to be cautious ahead of the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/ecb-president-lagarde-speaks-1965"" id=""5fc34ccd6a51b"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1965"">ECB</a></span> press conference this Thursday, which could dampen the rally if Ms. Lagarde paints a highly negative picture of the post-COVID recovery.</p>
<p>The US calendar today is barren and price action is likely to be driven by whatever news-flow comes from the streets of US cities. So far, the protests have only turned violent against property and while the economic damage has been substantial, the market has basically ignored the developments as a one-off event. However, if President Trump makes good on his promise to militarize the response and if that, in turn, causes more loss of human life, the market will no longer be able to ignore the brewing political crisis in the US.</p>

<p>Disturbance 1 has a 20% chance to form a hurricane as it meanders in the southern Gulf of Mexico and could be a 50% threat if it does not make landfall in the next five days.

    </div>
        <p>Investing.com - U.S. wheat futures declined to the lowest level in three weeks on Wednesday, amid ample global supplies and indications of reduced demand for U.S. wheat.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc34410eecf6"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">US wheat</a></span> for May delivery fell to $5.0040 a bushel, a level not seen since February 3, before recovering to trade at $5.0463 during U.S. morning hours, up 1.48 cents, or 0.29%.</p>
<p>A day earlier, wheat eased down 0.2 cents, or 0.05%, to settle at $5.0360.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc34410ef1fa"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">US corn</a></span> for May delivery inched up 0.47 cents, or 0.12%, to trade at $3.8588 a bushel.</p>
<p>US corn for May delivery dropped 1.2 cents, or 0.32%, on Tuesday to end at $3.8540 as losses in wheat weighed on prices.</p>
<p>Wheat and corn prices are linked because both can be used as animal feed.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the Chicago Board of Trade, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34410ef335"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">US soybeans</a></span> for May delivery shed 3.02 cents, or 0.3%, to trade at $10.1538 a bushel.</p>
<p>The May soybean contract rallied to $10.3200 on Tuesday, the most since January 12, before closing at $10.1860, up 17.2 cents, or 1.72%, as concerns over a disruption to supplies from Brazil boosted prices.</p>
<p>A strike by Brazilian truck drivers protesting high fuel prices continued for the seventh day on Tuesday, threatening to hold up grains exports at the nation's second-largest grain hub in Paranagua.</p>
<p>However, Brazilian authorities imposed fines on truckers for blocking the roads on Wednesday, indicating the strike may be ending.</p>
<p>Brazil is a major soybean exporter and competes with the U.S. for business on the global market. A disruption to supplies there could mean increased demand for U.S. supplies.</p>
<p>Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, government figures show. Wheat was fourth, behind hay.</p>

        <p>By Barani Krishnan </p>
<p>Investing.com - It finally got done. And we’re back to arguing what good it can do, now that it’s done.</p>
<p>I’m talking, of course, about the $200 billion U.S.-China deal signed at the White House this week, the so-called phase one agreement that will attempt to end the mother-of-all trade wars - even as there are calls for a phase two to start from where the phase one will end.</p>
<p>The two-year long interim deal - which, interestingly, is proportionate to the duration of the trade war between the Trump and Xi governments - has been turned inside out since it was inked Wednesday. And the first holes have been poked by reviewers at China’s commitment to buy $52 billion of U.S. crude oil and other energy products. Negative speculation over the deal was enough to send <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc350716a4a6"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">West Texas Intermediate</a></span>, the benchmark for U.S. crude, down almost 1% on the week as it settled Friday at $58.54 per barrel. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/brent-oil"" id=""5fc350716a755"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8833"">Brent</a></span>, the global benchmark for crude, rose a modest 0.2% to settle at $64.85.</p>
<p>Further weighing on crude prices Friday was the weekly <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/u.s.-baker-hughes-oil-rig-count-1652"" id=""5fc350716badf"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1652"">oil rig count</a></span> published by industry firm Baker Hughes, which showed drillers adding 14 rigs to bring to 673 the total number across U.S. oil fields.  A higher rig count, in the simplest sense, means higher crude production. Over the past two weeks, the rig count had fallen, extending last year’s drop of 208.</p>
<p></p><p>On the precious metals front, gold benefited from the negative media swirl over the phase one as the safe-haven continued to seek a hedge to potential troubles in the deal. But more than gold, it was palladium that rocked precious metals this week as the auto-catalyst shot to a new all-time high above $2,500 an ounce - up 28% within just two weeks after a 55% gain throughout 2019. More in the precious metals review section below. </p><p></p>
<p><strong>Energy Review</strong></p>
<p>From the energy aspect of the phase one alone, there were as many arguments on whether the audacious demands made by Trump on China were plausible, as there were concerns about the impact that Beijing’s assumed compliance will have on global commerce.</p>
<p>With both sides retaining much of the tariffs imposed on each other over the past two years - Trump for leverage against Beijing and Xi to ensure no loss of “face” for the Chinese - analysts were unsure of how the step-up in trade could occur.     </p>
<p>“The consensus expectation is that if the deal is respected, China’s <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc350716a834"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">crude oil</a></span> imports from the US will rise to at least 500,000 barrels per day from zero in last October,” said Olivier Jakob, founder of Petromatrix, an oil risk consultancy in Zug, Switzerland. “However, at this stage, it is difficult to see how China would do this with its current import tariffs; something must change there,” Jakob added. </p>
<p>He also said that if China were to increase its U.S. energy consumption to fulfill the deal, the United States would account for almost all of Chinese oil import growth in the next 12 months, “to the detriment of OPEC+ and the North Sea”. OPEC+ groups the Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries with non-OPEC members like Russia. The North Sea is the production hub for <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/brent-oil"" id=""5fc350716ab7f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8833"">Brent</a></span>.</p>
<p>Jakob’s perspective was shared by Refinitiv oil columnist Clyde Russell, who went a step further in questioning the impact that such Chinese compliance would have on the global oil trade.</p>
<p>“The problem for energy markets isn't whether China can actually buy the amount of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc350716ad5d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">crude oil</a></span>, coal and liquefied <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/natural-gas"" id=""5fc350716ae33"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8862"">natural gas</a></span> it has apparently committed to under the trade truce with the United States,” Russell wrote in a Jan. 16 commentary.  “The real issue is what happens if Beijing tries and succeeds?”</p>
<p>Russell explained that as part of the agreement, China agreed to buy at least $52.4 billion in additional energy purchases over the next two years, from a baseline of $9.1 billion in 2017. That will be broken into $18.5 billion in 2020 and $33.9 billion in 2021.</p>
<p>The best-ever month for China's imports from the United States was June 2018, when 14 million barrels arrived, according to Refinitiv data.</p>
<p>If that record performance is annualized, Russell said it would mean that China would buy about 170 million barrels, worth some $9.82 billion based on the Jan. 16 price of $57.81 for a barrel for WTI.</p>
<p>“For China to reach the 2020 target of $27.6 billion in energy imports from the United States, it would take more than a doubling of the record months achieved in the past,” Russell noted. “It also remains to be seen how China's existing suppliers would react to losing market share in the world's top crude importer: Would they simply roll over, or, more likely, try to protect their market share while going after U.S. customers outside of China?”</p>
<p>China’s biggest oil suppliers have historically been from the Middle East, led by Saudi Arabia, which is the third largest crude producer after the United States and Russia.</p>
<p>Energy aside, there were also questions about the agricultural portion of the deal, worth $32 billion. Netherlands-based Rabobank estimated that Chinese imports of U.S. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc350716af1c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc350716afea"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">corn</a></span>  — often the only farm products talked about by the media during the trade war — would account for just about half or more of the deal.</p>
<p>China would have to buy a lot more of food and farm products --  including meat, seafood, dairy and cotton — to honor its commitment to the agricultural portion, said Rabobank. “To facilitate the high procurement, most of the existing retaliatory tariffs are expected to be removed soon,” it said. That adds to the growing belief that the tariffs, which became the catalyst to the trade war and which remain even after the signing of the phase one, could drown the deal unless the two sides have the will to move on.</p>
<p></p><p>** After markets closed Friday, reports emerged Saturday that Libya’s National Oil Corp has declared force majeure on oil exports from five ports — Brega, Zueitina, Ras Lanuf, Hariga and Sidra — under the control of renegade general Khalifa Hafta. A military strongman trying to seize political power in Libya, Haftar, halted oil shipments at the five ports to gain leverage ahead of peace talks in Berlin on Sunday. Analysts estimated that least 800,000 barrels per day of crude supplies out of Libya had been disrupted. The oil-rich North African state had steadily pumped 1.3 million bpd before that. </p><p></p>
<p>Investing.com’s estimate is that <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/brent-oil"" id=""5fc350716b0cf"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8833"">Brent</a></span> could trade at a premium of up to $2 per barrel or more when Asian and European markets reopen Monday, while U.S. markets remained closed for the Martin Luther King holiday.</p>

<p><strong>Precious Metals Review</strong></p>
<p>It seems difficult to keep gold more than a day with speculation going back and forth of the potential success of the U.S.-China deal. More interestingly, it’s virtually impossible to push down palladium, which hit record highs again Friday on supply concerns.</p>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc350716b288"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">Gold futures</a></span> for February delivery on New York’s COMEX settled up $3.10, or 0.6%, at $1,560.30 per ounce. For the week, it was flat.</p>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/xau-usd"" id=""5fc350716b38d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""68"">Spot gold</a></span>, which tracks live trades in bullion, was up $7.91, or 0.5%, at $1,560.45. For the week, it was down 0.3%.</p>
<p>Gold prices had initially fallen after China agreed to purchase at least $200 billion worth of US goods over the next two years under the Phase One deal signed on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But as the days progressed, analysts have questioned the potential success of the deal, and the chances of the trade war recurring with both nations keeping much of the tariffs they had imposed on each other prior to the agreement.</p>
<p>“Following a noteworthy positioning squeeze, the yellow metal is creeping higher once again,” TD Securities said in a note. “Along with positive expectations for growth comes the potential for inflation to creep higher, and without a commensurate Fed response, this would translate into lower real rates.”</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve cut rates by a quarter percent point for three months back-to-back in 2019, before bringing that easing cycle to a halt in December. With U.S. economic data mostly upbeat now, analysts do not expect the central bank to embark on a new round of cuts unless the trade war recurs.</p>

<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc34ac34b431"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">GOLD</a></span></strong> has started the week negatively as an improvement in the trade outlook and increased risk appetite reduce the need for the safe haven asset. The lack of upward momentum is taking its toll on speculative long positions, which were trimmed to the least since the week of July 23, according to last week’s data snapshot from CFTC. Yesterday, Bloomberg reported that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) had increased gold holdings to 2,553 tons, a near seven-year high.</p>
<p>There were reports of 15 deaths at a Siberian gold mine after a dam collapsed, though this is not expected to impact supply a great deal.Gold remains trapped in a downward-sloping channel which has been in place since Sept. 4. The channel boundaries are at 1,440 and 1,506 today with the 55- and 100-day moving averages at 1,506 and 1,457 respectively providing narrower parameters.</p>
<p>While <strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/silver"" id=""5fc34ac34b795"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8836"">SILVER</a></span></strong> has seen wild swings over the past four weeks, the Friday closing prices have kept within a very tight 17.5498-17.5593 range, suggesting neither bulls nor bears are gaining the upper hand. Bullish bets on silver were cut to the least in nine weeks in the week to Oct. 15, according to data from CFTC. The gold/silver (Mint) ratio hit the lowest since September 26 yesterday after three days of losses.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/platinum"" id=""5fc34ac34b8af"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8910"">PLATINUM</a></span></strong> prices have been mostly capped by the 55-day moving average, which is at 901.59 today, since end-September, with one exception. That breakout occurred on Oct. 10 but failed to sustain the move, even for one day.</p>
<p>Speculative investors remain bullish on the commodity, increasing net long positions for a second consecutive week, according to the latest data from CFTC. Bloomberg reported yesterday that ETFs had increased platinum holdings for a sixth day, adding 2,555 troy ounces.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/palladium"" id=""5fc34ac34b9b8"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8883"">PALLADIUM</a></span></strong> is taking a breather after its latest run up to record highs last Thursday. Bloomberg has suggested that the shortage of palladium is evident in the cost of lease rates for the metal. One week lease rates have hit the highest since January, it reported citing data from Johnson Matthey, implying a lack of supply in the market. The report also saw the 2019 supply/demand shortfall at 809,000 ounces.</p>
<p>ANZ Bank said in a report last week that the supply deficit could run for the foreseeable future. The bank noted that the rally over the past four years has seen shorter and shallower retracements each time.</p>
<p>Speculative investors turned net sellers of palladium for the first time in six weeks in the week to Oct. 15, but actual long positions remain at the highest since the week of Feb. 26, CFTC data show.</p>
<h2><strong>Base metals</strong></h2><p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/copper"" id=""5fc34ac34bac1"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8831"">COPPER</a></span></strong> advanced for the second week in a row last week as progress appeared to be made in the U.S.-China trade negotiations, with likely positive implications for global growth. A positive start to this week, which saw copper reach the highest level since Sept. 16, appears to be running out of steam today and the metal is facing the first losses in four days. The improving growth outlook prompted speculative investors to turn net buyers of the metal for the first time in four weeks in the week to Oct. 15, according to CFTC data.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The sub-categories in China’s September industrial production data saw copper output rising 11.6% from a year earlier to 838,000 tons. A strike in most ports in Chile gave copper a temporary boost. Chile is the world’s biggest copper producer, supplying 5.8 million tons in 2018, which was equal to about 28% of global output. Copper stocks at warehouses monitored by the London Metal Exchange (LME) fell Friday for the first time in four days.</p>
<p></p><h2><strong>Energy</strong></h2>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/natural-gas"" id=""5fc34ac34bbfc"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8862"">NATURAL GAS</a></span></strong> has given back almost all of last week’s 6.2% gains this week as the downward trend continues. The commodity fell the most since January yesterday. Constant oversupply has prevented prices from rallying too far, with the latest weekly stockpiles data showing 104 billion cubic feet (bcf), up from 98 bcf the previous week and above the 5-year average of 81 bcf.</p>
<p>China’s natural gas output increased 10.6% y/y in September, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, but the nation still imported 71.2 million tons in the month, a 10% increase from a year earlier. Speculative investors remain bearish on the commodity, increasing net short positions to the highest since August 27, according to the latest CFTC data.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc34ac34bd11"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">CRUDE OIL</a></span></strong> prices are stuck at low levels but are still managing to hold above the June and August lows of $50.54 and $50.47 respectively. Prices have fallen for the past three days, the longest stretch since the beginning of the month, and could be facing a second weekly loss in a row as investors weigh the better outlook for a trade deal against slowing global growth after China’s Q3 <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/gdp-461"" id=""5fc34ac34c47d"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""461"">GDP</a></span> growth numbers came in below forecast.</p>
<p>Speculative investors have not given up hope after increasing net long positions for the first time in five weeks in the week to October 15.</p>
<h2><strong>Agriculturals</strong></h2><p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34ac34be3c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">SOYBEANS</a></span></strong> are marking time after reaching the highest since June 2018 last week. A commitment by China to buy more U.S. agricultural products is supporting prices and speculative accounts have been boosting net long positions for the last five weeks, lifting them to the highest since June last year in the latest report from CFTC. Dryness during the South American seeding season has raised questions about yield prospects later.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-sugar-no11"" id=""5fc34ac34bf65"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8869"">SUGAR</a></span></strong> prices have been facing a lot of technical resistance points recently, with the 200-day moving average, now at 0.1207, holding back a rally on October 2 and the 100-week moving average at 0.1215 capping prices on a closing basis since June.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Foreign Advisory Service has cut its forecast for India’s sugar output for the next 12 months starting this month to 29.3 million tons from 34.3 million tons previously, a 15% reduction.</p><div class=""outerEleWrapper"">

Speculative investors were net buyers for a third week in the week to Oct.15, with the overall positioning turning long again for the first time in six weeks.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc34ac34c1ac"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">WHEAT</a></span></strong> prices have retreated from Fibonacci resistance at 5.285, the 78.6% retracement of the June-September decline, this week. Prices have been rising after the WASDE report two weeks ago scaled back the supply forecasts for this season. The shift saw speculative accounts turn net buyers for the first time in four weeks in the reporting week to Oct. 15 and switching net positioning to long.</p>

The bad news: soybean growers can no longer rely on automatic Chinese demand.</p><p></p>
<p>From a preset commitment to buy American soybeans, the terminology changed to a pledge to buy U.S. soybeans based on “market conditions.” In other words, based on demand back home. And if demand falls? China will reduce its orders. A primary use for soybean is pigfeed. The numbers of Chinese swine dwindled amid the recent swine fever <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/news/commodities-news/chinas-beef-imports-hit-record-as-deadly-swine-fever-spreads-1931079"" id=""5fc34c3a3adf5"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""oal"" data-articleid=""1931079"">epidemic</a></span>.</p>
<p></p><p>As a result, we can expect Chinese demand for U.S. soybeans to drop, especially considering that tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods remain in effect despite the signing and that the U.S. is moving to further limit sales to China’s tech giant Huawei.</p><p></p>
<p>Investors didn’t waste any time in reacting, pushing prices down to the lowest since Dec. 19.</p>
<p></p><p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img title=""U.S. Soybeans Futures Daily Chart"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picff1dd4cd0e7a3b08068c80b01b1c9934.png"" alt=""U.S. Soybeans Futures Daily Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">U.S. Soybeans Futures Daily Chart</span></div></div></div><p></p><p></p>
<p>The selloff drove the contract below its $927 support level since the four sessions it required to muster enough juice to break through that price level from the downside, Dec. 17 through Dec. 20.</p>
<p></p><p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img title=""U.S. Soybeans Futures Weekly Chart"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picb9c07d33bc6abc7dca675e0e1383e3d5.png"" alt=""U.S. Soybeans Futures Weekly Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">U.S. Soybeans Futures Weekly Chart</span></div></div></div><p></p><p></p>
<p>However, even during the optimism ahead of the watered-down Chinese commitment, prices were stuck below the $950 area as they found resistance by the top of a falling channel since June 2016. In the weekly chart, we also noticed that prices failed to remain above the $935 levels. True to this resistance line, while soybeans futures closed above that supply-line ahead of the trade deal, they’ve crashed back below after it.</p>
<p></p><p>While, the adage “buy the rumor, sell the news” may play a role, based on the fundamental change in language and technical map, we think investors have reversed their outlook on growth in sales.</p><p></p>
<p>In the daily chart, the price’s topping out is backed up by both the MACD – whose short-term MA fell back below the long-term MA, from an overbought condition – and the RSI – which has not only fallen back from the oversold, 70 level, but also provided a negative divergence to the price, whose lows were flat and whose highs rose.</p>
<p>In the weekly chart, we observe that the price action developed a rising wedge, bearish within the falling channel since mid-2016. The pattern’s presumed resistance is compounded by its top – which the price has just retested for the fourth straight week, confirming its resistance each time.</p>
<p>Finally, the 200-week MA is connecting the resistances of both the wedge and the channel tops. The RSI has been unable to stay above the 56 level since the beginning of December.</p>
<p></p><p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img title=""U.S. Soybeans Futures Monthly Chart"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic845ad7849ac7e227d4066c93c80d7428.png"" alt=""U.S. Soybeans Futures Monthly Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">U.S. Soybeans Futures Monthly Chart</span></div></div></div><p></p><p></p>
<p>And when we take yet another step back, what emerges is potentially a massive top spanning more than a decade since the 2008 crash, the downside of which is an unknown abyss.</p>
<p>The fundamentals and technicals, in both the daily and the weekly charts, demonstrate that risk is to the downside.</p>
<p></p><h2>Trading Strategies</h2><p></p>
<p><em>Conservative traders</em> would wait for a downside breakout of the wedge, below $900, before shorting.</p>
<p><em>Moderate traders</em> could short after a closing with at least one long red candle below the $925 level, the bottom of the congestion since December, as discussed above; then, wait for a return move that would be stumped by overwhelming supply.</p>
<p><em>Aggressive traders</em> might risk a short right after the close below the $925 level, awaiting no further confirmation that supply has drowned out demand at these levels.</p>

1606634502-5025,https://www.investing.com/commodities/us-soybeans-opinion/6,Muted Asian Markets After China-U.S. Trade War De-Escalation,https://www.investing.com/analysis/muted-asian-markets-after-chinaus-trade-war-deescalation-200492668,"By MarketPulse (Jeffrey Halley)Market OverviewDec 16, 2019 12:18AM ET","<p><strong>China and the U.S. reset their phasers to stun on Friday, announcing more details of their “phaser-one” bilateral trade agreement.</strong> Concrete progress at last at de-escalating their trade-war that has dogged both countries, and indeed the world, for the previous two years.</p>
<p>In broad terms, the U.S. has cancelled the next round of tariffs on Chinese imports that were due yesterday. It reduced tariffs from 15% to 7.5% on another $120 billion of goods but keeps 25% tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese imports. China, for its part, has apparently committed to purchases of $200 billion of American goods over the next two years. Of, that some $80-$100 billion will be agricultural goods with the remainder split between manufactured products and energy. It will immediately ban forced technology transfers by American companies as a condition of market entry to China, and tighten intellectual property protection.</p>
<p>Overall, the agreement, assuming its passes mostly unchanged, looks like a fair one for both sides. It allows the leaders of both countries to maintain their dignity. The more robust talks are to come in 2020, but that is a story for another day. It is a big win for President Trump amongst some important rural and manufacturing constituencies with an election year ahead. Some doubt has been expressed about how China will import that much food in dollar terms. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34bfe11066"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span>, for example, are mostly used for pig feed. China’s African swine flu epidemic has wiped out half of those. China will also have to tread a fine line with other export partners, who will be the first to cry WTO-wolf if China is appearing to favor the U.S. over them.</p>
<p>Coming hard on the heels of an agreement in the U.S. Congress to pass the successor to NAFTA, the USMCA, it capped a productive week on trade. It is, therefore, no surprise that equities are at or near record highs globally with most major and EM currencies rallying against the greenback last week.</p>
<p>Other weekend news shows that trade tensions are still alive and well, however. China has threatened to retaliate against Germany if it excludes Huawei Technologies as a vendor to supply 5G wireless telecommunications equipment. With Germany’s vital manufacturing sector <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/german-manufacturing-pmi-136"" id=""5fc34bfe123c0"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""136"">suffering more than most</a></span> in the global economic slowdown and trade-war crossfire, the threat will send shivers through the corridors of power in Berlin.</p>
<p>Germany’s position is a much weaker one than America’s, mostly because its <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/german-exports-1368"" id=""5fc34bfe12808"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1368"">export</a></span> sector powers the economy and not the German consumer. Germany has been warned ad nauseam about this fragility before. It may be about to receive some harder-love from China to drive that home. The best that Germany can hope for is a show of EU unity behind them. The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/eur-usd"" id=""5fc34bfe112bd"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""1"">euro</a></span> is likely to start the week on the back foot because of it.</p>
<p>After the plethora of good news on trade and a resounding Conservative victory in the UK, one would have expected North America to push stocks and commodities vigorously onto greater heights. Instead, markets finished with more a whimper than a yell. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/gbp-usd"" id=""5fc34bfe1137f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""2"">Sterling</a></span>, in particular, gave back some of its gains, ending one per cent on the day. I am not reading too much into Wall Street’s Friday price action. Markets were clearly heavily positioned for the outcomes that occurred. Much to the surprise of everybody, they all did! Banking some well-earned profits at the week’s end and the year’s end, was the order of the day after a tumultuous week.</p>
<p>Regional Asia is likely to have more juice still to come in the global recovery trade, after the announcement of the interim trade agreement. Most countries in the Asia-Pacific region have a high beta to China, and the deal will overcome many of the dark economic clouds, into the year-end at least. Even if Asia follows the profit-taking mood of Wall Street today, the lull is likely to be temporary. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/singapore-straits-time"" id=""5fc34bfe11438"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""40006"">Singapore</a></span>, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/kospi"" id=""5fc34bfe11501"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""37426"">South Korea</a></span> and Malaysia come to mind as potential immediate beneficiaries. Agricultural exporters such as Australian and New Zealand may feel more cautious though.</p>
<p>China’s Fixed Investment, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/retail-sales-465"" id=""5fc34bfe128b7"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""465"">Retail Sales</a></span> and most importantly, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/industrial-production-462"" id=""5fc34bfe1295d"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""462"">Industrial Production</a></span> data are today’s highlights in Asia. It would be a good day to release weak data. Below-average prints are likely to be quickly forgotten, as markets contemplate an apparent brave new world on trade.</p>
<p>Interspliced with the China data is a round of PMI announcements today. The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/manufacturing-pmi-1838"" id=""5fc34bfe129eb"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1838"">Commonwealth Bank Flash PMI</a></span> has been released and has once again disappointed as Australia’s domestic economy remained mired in the gloom. Japan <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/manufacturing-pmi-202"" id=""5fc34bfe12bf9"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""202"">Jibun PMI</a></span> is released today as well, but the most closely watched will be Germany’s Markit Manufacturing PMI at 1630 SGT. Markets are looking for a gentle recovery to 44.5.</p>
<p></p><h2><strong>Equities</strong></h2>
<p>Unsurprisingly, it was a choppy session for equities on Friday. Wall Street’s leading indices initially roared higher as the phase-one trade deal was announced, but softer than expected U.S. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/retail-sales-256"" id=""5fc34bfe12ca3"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""256"">Retail Sales</a></span> and profit-taking eroded most of those gains. The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/us-spx-500"" id=""5fc34bfe115ba"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""166"">S&amp;P 500</a></span> was flat, the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/nasdaq-composite"" id=""5fc34bfe1165e"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""14958"">NASDAQ</a></span> rose 0.20%, and the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/us-30"" id=""5fc34bfe11715"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""169"">Dow Jones</a></span> finished 0.04% lower.</p>
<p>Regional Asian markets, having enjoyed a durable finish to last week, are likely to take a more optimistic view to proceedings, and continue moving higher today. The trade war has weighed heavily on the region with much of its economy closely tied to China. With the interim trade agreement removing some uncertainty, underperformers such as Singapore and South Korea, look well-placed to reap the benefits of any peace dividends.</p>
<p>Australia to should enjoy a positive start to the day, but both it and New Zealand may find the bullish tone muted with the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/s-p-asx-100"" id=""5fc34bfe117c6"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""14496"">ASX 100</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/nzx-50"" id=""5fc34bfe11c41"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""41146"">NZX 50</a></span> already at near-record highs. Both are major agricultural exporters to China and may suffer a “crowding-out effect” from the Mainland as they ramp up purchases from the U.S. instead.</p>
<p>Protests returned to Hong Kong yesterday, as its beleaguered CEO, attends a performance evaluation with her bosses in Beijing. The scale of demonstrations, however, appears to have abated for now. Combined with the interim trade agreement, Hong Kong’s bombed-out shares will likely be at the top of many investors Christmas wish lists this week.</p>
<h3><strong>Currencies</strong></h3>
<p>The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/usdollar"" id=""5fc34bfe11cfe"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""942611"">Dollar Index</a></span> fell 0.23% on Friday, led by gains in the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/gbp-usd"" id=""5fc34bfe11db7"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""2"">GBP</a></span>. The dollar, generally, spent the day on the back foot as the initial rise in U.S. bond yields unwound. With more concrete details of the interim trade-deal released from both sides, the dollar struggled versus EM.</p>
<p>The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/eur-usd"" id=""5fc34bfe11e77"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""1"">EUR/USD</a></span> rallied to 1.1200 on Friday, boosted by the strong Conservative election win. However, the rally quickly faded as GBP to gave up some of its gains, falling back to close almost flat at 1.1120. The single currency will struggle to recapture those heights this week, especially as China hinted at retaliation against Germany if Huawei gets placed on a 5G exclusion list. The 1.1200 region was probably the December high, albeit briefly, as attention will now turn to EU data and the impending trade talks with Britain.</p>
<p>GBP/USD raced from 1.3175 to a high of around 1.3510 in Friday as the election results pointed to a landslide victory, and Brexit certainty, for the Conservatives. Once the results were in though, sterling could not hold all of its gains. It fell to close at 1.3340, a respectable 1.20% gain for the day that belied a tumultuous session. The fall in sterling I put down entirely to profit-taking and lower liquidity, with the street having been locked and loaded for this trade for the past two weeks. Like euro, with all the news baked in, and the end of the year near, 1.3500 may represent the month’s high.</p>
<p>The off-shore yuan (<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-cnh"" id=""5fc34bfe11f2b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""961728"">USD/CNH</a></span>) has endured a rollercoaster ride over the last two trading sessions. It rallied on rumours of a trade deal on Thursday, with USD/CNH falling from 7.0250 to 6.9250, only to climb back to 7.0025 on Friday as details were officially announced. Fast money flows and positioning having passed, USD/CNH is now at what I consider to be a relatively market neutral rate of 7.0000. Ranging between 6.9500 to 7.0500 may well be USD/CNH’s fate this week as the dust settles and books are closed.</p>
<h2><strong>Oil</strong></h2><p>The interim trade agreement seemed mostly priced in on oil markets on Friday, given the rallies on both <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/brent-oil"" id=""5fc34bfe11fe1"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8833"">Brent</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc34bfe1209a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">WTI</a></span> in the proceeding weeks. Both contracts ended the week with modest gains. Brent crude rose 0.90% to $64.90 a barrel, having traded at $65.70 earlier in the session. WTI broke the $60.00 barrier, rising to $60.45 intraday, but could not hold those gains. It fell back on weeks end profit-taking to record a 1.0% gain, closing at $59.75 a barrel.</p>
<p>The failure of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/brent-oil"" id=""5fc34bfe12153"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8833"">Brent</a></span> to breach the $66.00 level, or WTI to hold above the $60.00 level, will disappoint some. It is important to note, though, that oil has been rallying strongly since early October. We now have both the OPEC+ cuts and the U.S.-China interim trade deal mostly concluded.</p>
<p>The relative strength indexes on both contracts remain elevated, but not overbought, suggesting that new bullish momentum is sustainable, should it arrive. The backwardation in both futures curves will also continue to be supportive of prices, supporting dips. Oil will probably consolidate its multi-week gains this week, but, baring any growth shocks, its overall rally is not yet over.</p>
<p></p><h2><strong>Gold</strong></h2><p>We should probably start calling <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc34bfe12209"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">gold</a></span> the forgotten war commodity, as it continues to get only walk-on parts in the global markets as other asset classes take the lead roles. Gold climbed a non-descript 0.44% to $1474.00 an ounce on Friday, lifted by a weaker dollar and lower U.S. Treasury yields.</p>
<p>Gold may come under some gentle selling pressure in Asia as weekend risk hedges are closed out. Overall, gold remains mired in its two-month $1450.00 to $1485.00 range and with most of the tier-1 event risk now out of the way, and the year-end beckoning, a break-out of either level is unlikely anytime soon — famous last words.</p>

The good to excellent rating for corn dropped to 71, down 2% from last week. Another reason the corn gained strength was silkings in the major US corn producing states of Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, and Nebraska are below the five-year average. And of course weather will play a critical role in prices, as the hot weather is supposed to hang around for a while, with rains forecasted on Friday. The drought index is not at critical levels, but this news was enough to have the shorts exit the market. There was a role-reversal in the overnight session with December corn currently trading at 351 ½ which is 4 ¾ cents lower. The trading range has been 357 ½ to 350 ½.</p>

A source quoted by S&amp;P Global Platts said: “If someone has ethanol, they need it”. The source continued: “If you want to buy some ethanol, you are going to have to buy the offer.” August ethanol posted a trade at 1.350 which was 0.031 higher.

Currently, 71% of the crop has a good- to excellent-rating, which is a drop from 75% last week. However, last year only 59% of the corn crop had this rating. The states in the western Corn Belt showed the largest decline in conditions ratings. Overall, the ratings are still favorable and if we stay above 70% good-to-excellent, the market will continue to look bearish.

The biofuels industry has been hit hard by the sharp decline in fuel demand as residents are following local, state and federal guidelines in social distancing and minimizing travel. Over 100 biofuel plants have fully idled, or cut production, with ripple effects on agriculture commodity prices. The EIA said almost all finished motor gasoline sold in the US is blended with 10% ethanol (E10), the drop in gasoline demand has driven similar decreases in fuel ethanol demand and fuel ethanol production.

In turn, we can expect increased cooking and eating at home. Because eating and drinking are such integral parts of our lives and economies, they can make attractive long-term investments.</p>
<p>According to a <a href=""https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/96957/ap-083.pdf?v=3429.7"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">report</a> by the United States Department of Agriculture in February 2020, in 2018, agriculture, food, and related industries in the US created around 22 million jobs (about 11% of employment).

<p>Investing in stocks or exchange-traded products (ETPs) in these industries may well add spice to long-term portfolios. Below are three ETPs providing exposure to the agricultural, food and beverage industries:</p><h2><strong>1. Invesco Dynamic Food &amp; Beverage ETF</strong></h2><ul><li>Current Price: $32.77</li>
<li>52 Week Range: $24.44-$35.45</li>
<li>Dividend Yield: 1.25%</li>

<p>The most important sectors (by weighting) are Food Processing (50.3%), Restaurant and Bars (17.68%) and Food Retail &amp; Distribution (15.41%).</p>
<p>The top five holdings make up slightly over 25% of total net assets, which stand at $80 million. They include Brown Forman (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/brown-forman-b"" id=""5fc34d54eb263"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8081"">BFb</a></span>), Mondelez International (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/mondelez-international-inc"" id=""5fc34d54eb332"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""32372"">MDLZ</a></span>), Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/monster-beverage"" id=""5fc34d54eb3f1"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""6355"">MNST</a></span>), PepsiCo (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/pepsico"" id=""5fc34d54eb4aa"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8358"">PEP</a></span>) and Hershey (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/hershey-co"" id=""5fc34d54eb55d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8052"">HSY</a></span>).</p>
<p>Year-to-date (YTD), the fund is down about 5%. But the comeback since the 52-week low hit in mid-March has been impressive. As a result, the fund's valuation has also become rich. The trailing P/E and P/B ratios are 44.79 and 2.97, respectively. We'd ideally wait for a potential pullback toward the $30-level before investing for the long-run.</p><h2><strong>2. iShares MSCI Global Agriculture Producers ETF </strong></h2><ul><li>Current Price: $29.36</li>
<li>52 Week Range: $18.36-$29.38</li>

<p>The fund, which includes 136 companies, follows the MSCI ACWI Select Agriculture Producers Investable Market index. The top five holdings make up over 40% of its total net assets, which are close $28 million. They are Deere (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/deere---co"" id=""5fc34d54eb6a8"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""261"">DE</a></span>), Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/archer-daniels-mid"" id=""5fc34d54eb894"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8080"">ADM</a></span>), Nutrien (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/nutrien"" id=""5fc34d54eb946"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""1057243"">NTR</a></span>), Corteva (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/corteva"" id=""5fc34d54eba0c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""1135949"">CTVA</a></span>) and Kubota (T:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/kubota-corp."" id=""5fc34d54eba91"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""44166"">6326</a></span>).</p>
<p>YTD, the VEGI is up about 1%. In fact, on Sept. 16, it hit a 52-week high. Since early spring, VEGI is up over 90%. As a result, the trailing P/E ratio of 19.26 and P/B ratio of 1.85 are a bit on the expensive side. Any potential decline toward the $27.5 level would improve the margin of safety. Long-term, we're bullish on the sectors represented in the fund.</p><h2><strong>3. UBS ETRACS CMCI Food Total Return ETN </strong></h2><ul><li>Current Price: $15.65</li>

Therefore, investors do not buy shares, but rather hold a bond-like certificate indicating the debt of UBS to the holder of the note.</p>
<p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img title=""FUD Daily"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pica1e3048138aee772551dc65d62e726dd.png"" alt=""FUD Daily""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">FUD Daily</span></div></div></div><p></p>

<p>FUD follows the <strong>UBS Bloomberg CMCI Food USD TR</strong> index, created in 2007. The top four commodities comprise over 55% of the ETN. They are <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34d54ebca8"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">Soybeans</a></span> (19.62%), <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-sugar-no11"" id=""5fc34d54ebd5c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8869"">Sugar #11</a></span> (15.01%), <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc34d54ebe0a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">Corn</a></span> (14.69%) and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/live-cattle"" id=""5fc34d54ebec2"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8914"">Live Cattle</a></span> (7.80%).</p>
<p>So far in the year, FUD is down around 6%. In fact, since 2010, the longer-term trend has been down. However, since the all-time low hit in March, the ETN is up around 15%.</p>
<p>Those investors interested in investing in agricultural and livestock commodities may want to study FUD more as well as pay attention factors influencing the industry. One good resource is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's monthly World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) <a href=""https://www.usda.gov/oce/commodity/wasde"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Reports</a></p>
<p>The weather plays a significant role in grain prices. The trade war rhetoric between the US and China potential also had an impact on US agricultural exports. Longer-term demand for most of these commodities will possibly grow because of demographics, i.e., feeding an increasing global population.</p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

It’s widely expected that the current level of production cuts will be extended at the meeting, and prices rebounded on Monday after Iraq said that deeper production cuts are on the horizon. Meanwhile, Nigeria has said that it is totally committed to OPEC+ production agreements and confirmed 100% compliance with its own limits in November.Speculative investors remain bullish on the prospects for oil, adding to net long positions in the week to November 26, according to the latest data from CFTC.

<p>Oil prices have been flitting around the 55- and 100-day moving averages at $55.80 and $55.79 respectively this week. Prices have struggled to overcome Fibonacci resistance at $58.675, which represents the 61.8% retracement of the drop from September 16 to October 3.</p>

The bulk of last month’s losses came on Friday, with a drop of 6.7%. Warmer than normal temperatures are forecast across most of the U.S. for the December 7-11 period, which has reduced expectations for future demand.<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/natural-gas-storage-386"" id=""5fc34b205b1aa"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""386"">Inventories</a></span> of natural gas fell by 28 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week to November 22, the second week in a row of drawdowns from stockpiles.

<p>The differing outcomes for the China and U.S. PMIs for October (China outperforming the U.S.) has had little impact on the precious metal.

<p>The gold/silver (Mint) ratio has been edging higher for the last four sessions, though there is a chance that streak may come to an end today. The 200-day moving average at 86.62 has been acting as near-term resistance since November 19.</p>

The precious metal has advanced almost 47% so far this year. Speculative investors pre-empted the last move as they turned net buyers for the first time in four weeks in the week to November 26, according to the latest report from CFTC.</p>
<p></p><h2><strong>Base metals</strong></h2><p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/copper"" id=""5fc34b205ac52"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8831"">COPPER</a></span></strong> prices fell for the previous three sessions as the outlook for a U.S.-China Phase 1 deal became more uncertain and cloudy. The metal is currently sitting just above the 55-day moving average at 2.6277, which has supported prices for the past 11 days.</p>

Last Friday, copper stocks at warehouses monitored by the London Metal Exchange (LME) were at the lowest since March 15. The prospect of revived demand and current low stock levels could be bullish for copper in the longer term.</p>

Recent surveys suggest that India’s sugar output for the current season may be 27.2 million tons, down 15% from the prior surveys conducted in March. The same surveys suggest Thailand’s sugar production will be down 10%. In addition, last week the International Sugar Organization revised its forecast for the 2019/20 global sugar deficit to 6.1 million tons, a 28% increase from a prior forecast.</p>
<p>Speculative investors have been caught wrong-footed by sugar’s recent rally as they are still net short of the commodity. However, shorts were scaled back for a fifth week to November 26, and they are now at the least since the week of July 16.</p>
<p>There has been a mild retracement in sugar of 1.4% so far this week which, if it continues, could bring a six-week rally to an end. However, prices may find support at the convergence of the 55- and 100-week moving averages at 0.1206 and 0.1202 respectively.</p><div class=""outerEleWrapper"">

Corn for ethanol use dropped by 50 million bushels, but is expected to climb with states slowly re-opening and favorable weather to get people stricken with cabin fever out and about. The USDA set the 2020 corn crop at 15.595 million bushels and farmers are expecting a larger number. Weather factors will be critical from here on out. We will also be keeping an eye on fund activity and farmer selling. December corn has another tight inside day trading range so far, currently trading at 343 ¼, which is a ½ of a cent lower.

    </div>
        <p>(Bloomberg) -- China plans to accelerate purchases of American farm goods to comply with the phase one trade deal with the U.S. following talks in Hawaii this week.</p>
<p>The world’s top <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc350c08487b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">Soybean</a></span> importer intends to step up buying of everything from soybeans to corn and ethanol after purchases fell behind due to coronavirus disruptions, said two people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the information is private.</p>
<p>A separate person said the Chinese government has asked state-owned agricultural buyers to make all efforts to meet the phase one agreement. Nobody from the commerce ministry responded to a fax seeking comment.</p>
<p>The plan offers respite to markets concerned about trade disruptions after the countries exchanged blows over everything from the origins of the coronavirus to new security legislation in Hong Kong. On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said China’s top foreign policy official committed to honor all of his nation’s commitments under the trade deal.</p>
<p>“During my meeting with CCP Politburo Member Yang Jiechi, he recommitted to completing and honoring all of the obligations of Phase 1 of the trade deal between our two countries,” Pompeo said in a tweet on Thursday, using an acronym for the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<p>Pompeo offered no details beyond the tweet, but that was the first substantive news out of the secretive meeting with Yang at Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii on Wednesday. It’s still unclear how the meeting came about or who had asked for it. Both sides have said the other initiated it.</p>
<p>China pledged to buy $36.5 billion worth of American agriculture products under the phase one deal, up from $24 billion in 2017, prior to the trade war.</p>
<p>However, China purchased only $4.65 billion in the first four months of the year, data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture show. That’s only 13% of the goal set in the trade deal and almost 40% below the same period in 2017.</p>
<p>China had asked state buyers to halt some purchases of American farm goods including soy, Bloomberg News reported earlier this month. However, Chinese importers had continued to increase its American soy purchases, picking up 2.2 million metric tons of the oilseed in the two weeks ended June 11, according to the USDA data.</p>

<p></p><p>The hangover was probably a result of traders (or their computers) buying the rumor (the U.S.-China trade deal was coming), and then selling the news (the trade deal is here).</p>
<p>There was also disappointment in a <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/retail-sales-256"" id=""5fc3503123dbb"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""256"">retail sales</a></span> report from the Commerce Department coming in lower for November than expected.</p><p></p>
<p>Except that it won't be signed until January and texts weren't available to show the details. The deal includes Chinese purchases of grains and other farm products and a commitment to crack down on patent piracy and other measures. In return, the U.S. agreed to reduce tariffs on $120 billion in products to 7.5% from 15%. That reduction will take effect 30 days after the agreement is signed. New tariffs that had been scheduled for Dec. 15 won't go into effect.</p>
<p>While President Donald Trump crowed about the deal, other officials, including economic advisor Larry Kudlow, were surprisingly wary of it. The deal will offer some confidence for business, Kudlow told CNBC Friday afternoon, but ""we will see how it works. We will see if the Chinese stay with their word.""</p>

<!--end-image--><p></p><h2><strong>Energy</strong></h2>
<p>The spread of the coronavirus is pressuring <strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc34c4cc9c42"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">Crude Oil</a></span></strong> prices amid expectations that the impact could affect global growth projections as Chinese companies remain closed for an extended period. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) hit levels not seen in more than a year in early trading this morning, and the decline has sparked speculation that OPEC may convene an extraordinary meeting to address the trend, with rumours circulating of a Feb. 4-5 gathering.</p>
<p>As a result of the virus, Bloomberg estimated that China’s oil demand has dropped by three million barrels, or about 20%, the biggest shock to demand since the Global Financial Crisis in 2008/09. The number of U.S. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/u.s.-baker-hughes-oil-rig-count-1652"" id=""5fc34c4ccae16"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1652"">oil rigs</a></span> in production tailed off last week, the first decline in three weeks.</p>
<p>Speculative investors reduced net long positions for a third consecutive week to January 28, according to the latest data snapshot from CFTC. Net longs are now at the lowest since the week of Dec. 3.</p>
<p>WTI fell for a fourth consecutive day yesterday as the number of confirmed coronavirus climbed above 20,000 globally and the number of deaths has risen to 426, an attrition rate of about 2%. The 100- and 200-day moving averages have converged just above the $57.00 mark.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/natural-gas"" id=""5fc34c4cca163"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8862"">Natural Gas</a></span></strong> prices remain under pressure despite forecasts of colder-than-normal temperatures in the U.S. for the Feb. 10-15 period. Prices are languishing near four-year lows with the 55-, 100- and 200-day moving averages all tending lower.</p>
<p>Speculators remain bearish on the commodity, with net short positioning matching the highs seen in June 2015. Data from the Energy Information Administration released last week showed a reduction of 201 billion cubic feet (bcf) in stockpiles, the biggest drop since March last year.</p>
<h2><strong> </strong><strong>Precious metals</strong></h2><p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc34c4cca2a0"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">Gold</a></span></strong> remains supported by the desire to hold safe haven assets during this virus period, but has so far lacked the momentum to maintain any break above the psychological 1,600 level. The metal advanced during December and January but is so far trading negatively this month.</p>
<p>Speculative accounts remain solidly bullish on gold however, increasing net long positions to the most since records began in 1993. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) increased their gold holdings for an eighth consecutive session as at yesterday, according to Bloomberg reports, bringing net purchases for the year to 730,000 ounces.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/silver"" id=""5fc34c4cca3ce"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8836"">Silver</a></span></strong> likewise has struggled to keep its upward trajectory during 2020 after reaching a near-term peak on January 8. It’s still maintaining a foothold above the 55-day moving average at 17.477 and that moving average has supported prices on a closing basis since Dec. 20.</p>
<p>The lack of upward momentum has tested the patience of silver bulls and speculative investors have reduced net long positions to the least in four weeks, according to CFTC data.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/palladium"" id=""5fc34c4cca4e2"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8883"">Palladium</a></span></strong> is consolidating last week’s drop which saw prices fall to the lowest in a week and more than 10% off the Jan. 21 peak. The recent decline has seen some speculative investors rush to book profits and net long positioning has been scaled back over the last three weeks to the lowest levels since the week of Sept. 11, the latest CFTC reports shows.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/platinum"" id=""5fc34c4cca5f0"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8910"">Platinum</a></span></strong> touched a 3-1/2 week low yesterday as global slowdown fears prompted concerns that industrial demand for the metal could wane. The 55-day moving average at 948.52 remains intact as support and prices have held above it since Dec. 10. Speculative investors remain bullish however, with net long positioning as of Jan. 28 at the highest levels since records began in 1993, according to the latest data from CFTC.</p><!--start-image-->

In the 10 days from Jan. 20, the metal has fallen 12.5% and reached levels now seen since Sept. 3. As at Jan. 28, speculative accounts turned net bearish on the metal for the first time in three weeks, according to CFTC data.</p>

Despite the lack of direction, there has been steady demand for U.S. produce, and it’s not from China. The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that U.S. corn exports were up 23% on the week to Jan.y 23, with demand coming from Mexico, Japan, Colombia and Guatemala.</p>
<p>The projected <strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-sugar-no11"" id=""5fc34c4cca923"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8869"">Sugar</a></span></strong> shortage for this season is keeping prices buoyant, hitting the highest level since January 2018 yesterday. Prices are nearing the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the September 2016 to August 2018 decline at 0.1508. That’s also close to the 200-month moving average at 0.1516.</p>

        <p>Investing.com - U.S. corn futures fell for the second consecutive session on Tuesday, after a report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture showed rapid planting progress in the U.S. Midwest last week.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc345cc08a85"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">US corn</a></span> for May delivery hit a session low of $3.7413 a bushel, the weakest level since April 16, before trading at $3.7440 during U.S. morning hours, down 2.83 cents, or 0.75%. A day earlier, corn futures lost 1.6 cents, or 0.46%, to settle at $3.7800.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture said Monday that approximately 9% of the corn crop was planted as of April 19, up from just 2% in the preceding week.</p>
<p>Nearly 6% of the crop was planted during the same week a year earlier, while the five-year average for this time of year is 13%.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc345cc08d89"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">US wheat</a></span> for May delivery slipped 3.98 cents, or 0.8%, to trade at $4.9463 a bushel. On Monday, wheat gained 4.2 cents, or 0.86%, to close at $4.9860.</p>
<p>The USDA said that the U.S. winter wheat crop was rated 42% good to excellent as of last week, unchanged from a week earlier. Approximately 34% of the crop was in good to excellent condition in the same week a year earlier.</p>
<p>The agency also said that 36% of the spring wheat crop was planted as of last week, up from 17% in the preceding week. Only 9% of the crop was planted in the same week a year earlier, while the five-year average for this time of year is 19%.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the Chicago Board of Trade, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc345cc090e7"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">US soybeans</a></span> for May delivery inched down 4.0 cents, or 0.41%, to trade at $9.7300 a bushel.</p>
<p>The May soybean contract hit $9.8100 on Monday, the most since April 7, before ending at $9.7740, after China's central bank cut banks' reserve requirement ratios in an effort to spur economic activity. The Asian nation is the world’s largest soybean consumer.</p>
<p>Gains were limited amid optimism over the outlook for supplies in South America. Brazil and Argentina are major soybean exporters and compete with the U.S. for business on the global market.</p>
<p>Large South American crop prospects could weigh on demand for U.S. supplies.</p>
<p>Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, government figures show. Wheat was fourth, behind hay.</p>

The weather remains a factor in the Corn Belt, with scattered precipitation and in some areas receiving up to two inches of rain inside the heat dome, which shows what a difference a few miles makes. We will be tuned in on weather in the coming weeks and also looking ahead to tomorrow's Crop Progress USDA Supply/Demand and WASDE data. And after that release, we will be looking at the USDA Crop Progress ratings and corn silkings on Monday. December Corn is currently trading at 359 ¼ which is 5 cents higher. The trading range has been 359 ¾ to 353 ¼.</p>
<p>According to the EIA, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/ethanol-futures"" id=""5fc352fb72a61"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""961732"">ethanol</a></span> production averaged 914,000 barrels a day, which is up 14,000 barrels last week, but still below a year ago, as blending is still a factor. Ethanol stocks were up for the first time in eleven weeks, but supplies remain very tight. Tomorrow's USDA report posting corn for ethanol use will be looked at as well.

China is also falling short in its purchases of US energy products to meet its targets under the phase-one trade deal signed with in January. And it is no secret they have been stacking their stockpiles in recent months with prices at these levels. Many analysts concur that China will fall short of the agreed target. The market is still trying to scratch its way and close above $41 a barrel. August crude oil is currently trading at 4082 which is down 8 points. The trading range has been 4099 to 4061.</p>

1606634515-5027,https://www.investing.com/commodities/us-soybeans-opinion/6,"As 2019 Ends, Renewed Risk Appetite Stoking Markets",https://www.investing.com/analysis/as-2019-ends-renewed-risk-appetite-stoking-markets-200495304,"By Marc ChandlerMarket OverviewDec 29, 2019 01:17AM ET","<p><strong>The year is winding down quietly, and the last week of 2019 is likely to be more of the same. The general mood of the market is quite different than a year ago. </strong>Then, investors had marked down equities dramatically amid fears of what was perceived as a synchronized downturn. Now with additional monetary easing in the pipeline and renewed expansion of the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank's balance sheets, risk appetites have been stoked.</p>
<p><strong>Previously, the notion that the central banks can tame the business cycle was dismissed as hubris. </strong>Now, however, investors seem to be acting as if the business cycle has not just been tamed but has all but disappeared. The combination of easing monetary policy, some countries turning to fiscal policy (e.g., Japan, the UK, Canada, New Zealand), and what appears to be an extended tariff truce between the two largest economies, lifts the animal spirits of risk-taking.</p>
<p><strong>However, just as we were skeptical of the profound bearishness a year ago, we are concerned now that the bullish is exaggerated. </strong>The Japanese economy is contracting, and India is slowing. Japan's preliminary <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/manufacturing-pmi-202"" id=""5fc34c0c3effc"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""202"">manufacturing PMI</a></span> was below the 50 boom/bust level for the eighth consecutive month. The final reading is not until January 5. India's <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/nikkei-markit-manufacturing-pmi-754"" id=""5fc34c0c3f448"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""754"">manufacturing PMI</a></span> rose in November for the first time since July. The December reading is due January 2. A year ago, it was above 53. Now it will be fortunate to remain above 51.</p>
<p><strong>The market was surprised by the tick up in China's November <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/manufacturing-pmi-594"" id=""5fc34c0c3f7da"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""594"">PMI</a></span>. Still, it did not presage an economic rebound as much as it signaled the economy may be stabilizing as the push for de-leveraging gives way renewed efforts to stimulate the economy.</strong> The November PMI gains are expected to be pared in December. China is not waiting for the legal trade document to be crafted. It continues to take measures that are consistent with the agreement and also in itself of interest. For example, China's <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34c0c3e6cf"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soy</a></span> imports from the U.S. more than doubled to 2. 6 mln tons in November from 1.1 mln tons in October. Officials have suggested that easier financial conditions will be forthcoming, and the overnight repo fell to its lowest rate in a decade last week. A reduction in the required reserve ratios has long been expected and could take place any day.</p>
<p><strong>While the eurozone's <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/services-pmi-1062"" id=""5fc34c0c3f89a"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1062"">service sector</a></span> has shown some resiliency, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/manufacturing-pmi-201"" id=""5fc34c0c3f94f"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""201"">manufacturing</a></span> remains in poor health. </strong>The preliminary December reading was sobering given better <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/german-ifo-business-climate-index-132"" id=""5fc34c0c3fd09"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""132"">German sentiment</a></span> readings and ideas the worst is passed. It fell back to 45.9 from 46.9. It bottomed in September at 45.7. The final estimate will be issued on January 2, while the final services and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/german-composite-pmi-1469"" id=""5fc34c0c400b0"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1469"">composite </a></span>reports are out the following week.</p>
<p><strong>Germany is the European engine. </strong>Its preliminary December <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/german-manufacturing-pmi-136"" id=""5fc34c0c4017b"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""136"">manufacturing PMI</a></span> dropped to 43.4 from 44.1. It was at 51.5 at the end of 2018. However, assuming no revision in the final estimate, the Q4 average of 43.2 would be the first quarterly increase since Q4 17. With new national strikes in France over pension reform, the economy may be vulnerable. The preliminary <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/french-manufacturing-pmi-340"" id=""5fc34c0c4022c"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""340"">manufacturing PMI</a></span> eased to 50.3 from 51.7. It bottomed at 49.7 in March and July. The silver lining is that with no revision, the French manufacturing PMI would average 50.9 in Q4, the strongest quarter since Q3 18. Spain and Italy's manufacturing was already in contraction in November, and it is expected to have deepened in December.</p>
<p><strong>At her recent press conference, ECB President Lagarde pushed back against claims of the ""Japanification of Europe"" or that the negative interest rates have reached the ""reversal point"" where they are deterring activity by pointing to the growth in lending to households and non-financial businesses. </strong>These figures will be updated with the money supply report on January 3. M3 growth is expected to have ratcheted up to 5.7% from 5.6%, which puts it at its fastest pace since 2009.</p>
<p><strong>The preliminary UK <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/manufacturing-pmi-204"" id=""5fc34c0c402d4"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""204"">manufacturing PMI</a></span> also fell in December. </strong>It returned to the trough set in August at 47.4 from 48.9 in November. The Bloomberg survey found that most economists suspect this is exaggerated and forecast that the final report on January 2 to be revised slightly higher. The following day, the UK is expected to report November <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/net-lending-to-individuals-221"" id=""5fc34c0c4065e"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""221"">lending data</a></span>, and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/boe-consumer-credit-666"" id=""5fc34c0c409d0"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""666"">consumer credit</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/mortgage-lending-664"" id=""5fc34c0c40e65"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""664"">mortgage lending</a></span> and approvals slowed. Investors seem to want to look past the near-term economic weakness anticipating a lifting of uncertainty over Brexit to fuel investment, helped by election promises of fiscal stimulus.

<!--end-image--><p><strong>It has been difficult to get a strong handle on the U.S. economy here in Q4. </strong>The Atlanta Fed says growth remains a little above what the Federal Reserve estimates to be its long-term sustainable path at 2.1%. The NY Fed's model shows growth decelerating to 1.3%. Recall the conflicting signals in the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/ism-manufacturing-pmi-173"" id=""5fc34c0c40f5f"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""173"">manufacturing ISM</a></span>, which rose (to 52.6 from 51.3) and the ISM, which fell (to 48.1 from 48.3) in November.

And there has been some improvement. Through October, the average monthly goods deficit has been $71.63 bln compared with $72.21 bln in the same 2018 period. However, it is statistically insignificant, and the underlying trend has been toward worsening. The average goods deficit in the first ten months of 2017 stood at $65.10 bln, and in 2016, it was about $60.76 bln.</p>
<p><strong>December <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/total-vehicle-sales-85"" id=""5fc34c0c42ee0"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""85"">auto sales</a></span> are expected to have slowed slightly from the 17.09 mln seasonally-adjusted annual pace in November. </strong>The average pace this year through last month is about 16.93 mln vehicles.

The median estimate is that policy can stay on hold in 2020, and in any event, the bar to a rate hike is higher than the bar to easing. This, coupled with the the Fed's assessment that policy setting is currently tiled toward slight accommodation, sees supportive conditions for risk-taking.</p>
<p><strong>The plumbing of the financial system came under new interest after the short-term refinancing rates jumped in September. </strong>The Fed has responded by conducting overnight repo operations, term repos (longer than overnight), and the purchase of $60 bln a month in T-bills. Despite some year-end pressures still evident, the Fed's moves seem to have balanced the conflicting policy objectives. The last three term operations that provided funding for the year-end turn were undersubscribed. The Federal Reserve will make as much as another $260 bln of liquidity available next week. The Federal Reserve is wrestling with reserves in the post-crisis era where excess reserves replaced a scarcity, but regulatory demands also impinge, and the low rates also shape the incentive structure. We continue to see this as an issue about the transmission of policy more than monetary policy itself.</p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

A strong bearish setup warned corn bulls months ago. While not enough traders/farmers read the Matrix, it doesn't matter if they claim ignorance or not. The invisible hand always wins.

And June looks even brighter. The month started nicely on Wall Street despite a civil unrest in America. U.S. manufacturing, consumer confidence and some housing data came in less scary and indicate chanes of a speedy recovery. Meanwhile, efforts for drug and vaccine developments for COVID-19 are ramping up.</p>
<p>Notably, June is not known for good returns. A consensus carried out from 1950 to 2019 shows that June ended up offering positive stock returns in 36 years and negative returns in 34 years, per <u><a href=""http://www.moneychimp.com/features/monthly_returns.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">moneychimp.com</a></u>, with an average positive return of 0.03%.</p>
<p>But this year, the investing and stimulus (both government and the Fed) backdrop is totally different. Global economies and corporates will leave no stone unturned to register a fast rebound from the COVID-19 slump.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, we highlight a few ETF options that can come across as intriguing bets for the month. The below-mentioned ETFs have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).</p>
<p><strong>S&amp;P 500 – Vanguard SP 500 ETF <a href=""http://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/VOO"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">VOO</a></strong></p>
<p>If you are unnerved by the single stock-picking approach in the current recessionary environment, you can simply bet on the S&amp;P 500 through a low-cost option like VOO.Warren Buffett is also a proponent of low-cost index fund investing. The average annualized total return for the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/us-spx-500"" id=""5fc3521390c69"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""166"">S&amp;P 500 index</a></span> over the past 90 years is around <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/22/warren-buffett-most-people-shouldnt-pick-single-stocks.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">10%</a> before adjusting for inflation and the index gives exposure to 80% of the U.S. market cap, per financial veterans. It yields about 1.88% annually and charges only 3 bps in fees. The fund has a Zacks Rank #2.</p>
<p><strong>Dividend – Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF <a href=""http://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/VYM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">VYM</a></strong></p>

Stocks with high dividend point to quality investing — a pre-requisite to making money in a volatile environment. Even if there is capital loss, dividend payments make up for it to a large extent. Moreover, at the record-low yield environment, Zacks Rank #2 VYM offers a juicy 3.42% yield annually (read: <a href=""https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/764007/guide-to-10-most-popular-dividend-etfs?art_rec=etfs-overview-zacks_news-ID02-txt-764007"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Guide to 10 Most Popular Dividend ETFs</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Communication – Communication Services Select Sector SPDR ETF <a href=""http://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/XLC"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">XLC</a></strong></p>
<p>The Zacks Rank #1 fund provides an effective representation of the communication services sector of the S&amp;P 500 Index. The COVID-19 outbreak brightened the appeal for the work-and-learn-from-home culture. With exponential growth in video and other bandwidth-intensive applications owing to the mass adoption of smartphones and increased deployment of 5G technology, the communication industry is to set to rule irrespective of the pandemic. The fund is heavy on the likes of Facebook (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/facebook-inc"" id=""5fc352139124d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""26490"">FB</a></span>), Alphabet (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/google-inc"" id=""5fc3521391394"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""6369"">GOOGL</a></span>), T-Mobile, Comcast (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/comcast-corp-new"" id=""5fc35213914cf"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""6516"">CMCSA</a></span>) and Verizon (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/verizon-communications"" id=""5fc352139164d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8127"">VZ</a></span>).</p>
<p><strong>Small-Caps – iShares SP SmallCap 600 Growth ETF <a href=""http://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/IJT"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">IJT</a> </strong></p>
<p>Massive Fed and government pandemic stimulus added fuel to the small-cap rally past month. Reopening of economies and the relative previous underperformance compared to the large caps, should add more strength ahead. Investors thus can bet on this Zacks Rank #1 fund (read: <a href=""https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/915925/smallcap-earnings-picture-5-sector-etf-stars"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Small-Cap Earnings Picture: 5 Sector ETF Stars</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Financials – Vanguard Financials ETF <a href=""http://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/VFH"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">VFH</a></strong></p>
<p>This has been a beaten-down space amid pandemic. However, with easing social distancing restrictions and the return of risk-on trade sentiments, long-term bond yields should jump higher in the near term. This should benefit financial stocks that perform well in a rising rate environment. The fund has a Zacks Rank #2.</p>
<p><strong>Corn – Teucrium Corn ETF <a href=""http://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/CORN"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CORN</a></strong></p>
<p>The underlying CBOT <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn?cid=961737"" id=""5fc35213917a4"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""961737"">Corn Futures</a></span> Contract looks to reflect the daily changes of a weighted average of the closing prices for three futures contracts for corn that are traded on the CBOT. The fund has a Zacks Rank #1, right now. The likelihood of China’s accomplishment of phase-one trade deal which promises buying of corn, the agricultural commodity’s usage in ethanol production and reopening of economies should favor the crop.</p>

        <p></p><p>Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures drifted higher early Friday in New York, consolidating overnight gains made after China said it would waive import tariffs on U.S. pork and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc3502502a98"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span>. </p><p></p>
<p>Beijing had applied tariffs of 25% on both products in response to similar measures by U.S. President Donald Trump earlier in the year. The move is, however, easy to over-interpret, given that China has suffered from acute inflation in pork prices this year as an epidemic of African swine flu has wiped out much of its pig population. There was no sign of China giving ground over other central U.S. demands in the trade talks. </p>

The Crop Production USDA Supply/Demand and all important WASDE data could shed some light on global exports and crop conditions. Yesterday’s weak Export Sales data across the board shows that this market is looking for signs of life and the WASDE data could be what the doctor ordered.

We are having a hot July with plenty of moisture, which is good for corn. There are talks that China may increase their quotas, but at the moment it is all talk and the market is not getting excited about it.</p>
<p>One farmer said we have been talking about this for two years if they want to talk the talk then walk the walk. We will see weekly Export Inspections and Crop Progress reports today. If yesterdays storm created any unknown damage with the high winds, hail and saturating rains, I really do not see much of an upside in trade prices.</p>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34ceddffde"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">Soybeans</a></span> could be supportive with that situation has the commodity at much tighter supplies than the corn side. We still have warm weather and rain forecasted mid-week which could pressure corn even further. December corn is currently trading at 335 ¾ which is 4 cents lower. The trading range has been 340 to 335 ¾. Soybean trade was higher in the overnight which may somewhat support corn as I said earlier, but with the weather fundamentals I would be watching fund activity.</p>
<p>In <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/ethanol-futures"" id=""5fc34cede008f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""961732"">ethanol</a></span>, Chuck Abbott with Successful Farming reported that ethanol revenue was cut by more than $3.4 billion, according to the Renewable Fuels Association on Wednesday, in the spring with stay-at-home orders and the economic slowdown. Ethanol consumption from March through June was 1.3 billion gallons lower than the average consumption in the same period for the past 3 years, RFA economist Scott Richman said.</p>
<p>The amount of corn used for ethanol production was 467 million bushels below average for the period. “The low point came in April, when ethanol production and consumption fell more than 40% compared with the same period over the last few years,” said the RFA analyst.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“To date, industry revenues have been reduced by over 43.4 billion. The negative effects are expected through the remainder of 2020 and 2021, even if the pandemic does not intensify and government restrictions such as those saw in spring are not reimposed.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The House passed a coronavirus relief bill in May that offered $2.5 billion in assistance to ethanol producers. Payment would 45 cents a gallon for production from January 1, 2020 to May 1, 2020 for plants that stayed open and 22.5 cents for plants that idled their production based on their production in the same period in 2019.</p>
<p>Other remedies have been proposed in freestanding bills. There were no trades posted in the overnight electronic session. The August contract settled at 1.170 and is currently showing 1 bid @ o.981 and 1 offer @ 1.126 with Open Interest at 64 contracts.</p>
<p>On the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc34cede0140"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">crude oil</a></span> market, OILPRICE.com reports that China’s hunger for oil is waning as China’s importers engaged in a massive buying spree which is now evaporating. In May, China’s crude imports soared to an all-time high, with imports at 47.97 million tons, or 11.34 million barrels a day, according to Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is Last Trading Day in August Crude Oil so we will roll to the September contract which is currently trading at 4045 which is 30 points lower. The trading range has been 4083 to 4020. The market has knocked on the door several times at $41 a barrel and ending up retreating. With resurfacing pandemic fears and potential lock-downs we could see OPEC+ decide to harden their recent production cuts at their last meeting. Demand destruction fears may be the story this week unless we grab another headline.</p>

Also I had questions from some producers of their thoughts on West Virginian lawmakers requesting that Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/berkshire-hathaway-inc"" id=""5fc34cede0296"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""20562"">BRKa</a></span>) Warren Buffett to make further investments in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline as he bought Dominion Energy's (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/dominion-res"" id=""5fc34cede036a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""7887"">D</a></span>) natural gas assets, and the answer was 100% in agreement and the answer was, he can always say NO! So we will see how this train rolls this week as well. August natural gas is currently trading at 1.688 which is 3 cents lower. The trading range has been 1.707 to 1.680.</p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

<p>For instance, if I buy <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc34db600a01"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">gold</a></span> because my “analysis” is that I think it could jump $10 today I don’t want to find myself still holding that position a month from now with gold down $100 because I’ve changed my “analysis” to believe that gold is in a multi-year uptrend.</p>
<p>If my original analysis had been that gold was in a multi-year uptrend I might have waited for a good setup to get long gold and I would have sized my position in keeping with my risk tolerance.</p>

<p>Over the past 6-week time frame, my analysis has been that the major U.S. stock indices, and the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/nq-100"" id=""5fc34db600db8"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""20"">Nasdaq 100</a></span> in particular, may have had a “blow-off” top in early September (I’ve called that a Key Turn Date) after a spectacular rally from the March lows.</p>
<p>There were at least two “poster child” events that illustrated the extreme bullish sentiment at the end of August. One was the sharp increase in the share price of both Apple (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/apple-computer-inc"" id=""5fc34db600ecd"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""6408"">AAPL</a></span>) and Tesla (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/tesla-motors"" id=""5fc34db600fe1"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""13994"">TSLA</a></span>) simply because they were doing a share split. (The split shares of both companies began trading August 31.) The other event was massive retail buying of short-dated OTM call options – “lottery tickets” as the floor brokers used to call them!</p>
<p>The major stock indices sold off from early September into late September and then rallied back to make a “lower high” around Oct 12 – 13. This “lower high” creates one of my favorite chart patterns…the double top with a lower right shoulder.</p>

If the market finds support around current levels and rallies back I will be stopped out with a small profit. (I lowered my stop as the market fell.) If the market continues lower I will try to add to my short position. The weekly chart gives some perspective on the rally since March and the amount this market could fall if we really did see a double top.</p>

<p>One last thought on the equity markets…what really seems to be happening is “rotation” away from the tech stocks that have been the leading lights since the March lows (and for the past couple of years) and into other stocks (for instance, the Transports are at all-time highs…small cap indices are strong.) I don’t know if this rotation is prudent rebalancing or pre-positioning ahead of a possible Biden win…or both.</p>
<p>Bond yields have been rising and the yield curve has been steepening the past three months (bank shares like a steeper curve.) Perhaps the prospect of massive issuance to finance unlimited government spending/stimulus is pressuring bond prices (bond yields up = prices down.) Perhaps the bond vigilantes are testing the Fed…perhaps the Fed doesn’t mind higher long term yields on the way to the 2+% inflation that say they want. The Fed already owns 22% of outstanding Treasuries…</p>

If risk sentiment reversed on the KTD after a giddy run-for-the-roses this summer then capital may well have sought the relative “safety” of the USD.

<p>The Canadian Dollar hit a 4 year low around 68 cents in March and rallied to a high of 77 cents on the September KTD (77 cents has been a lid on CAD for the past 2 years.) CAD has rallied the past 4 weeks as the USD has weakened and is now in a very interesting position. If it rolls over here it would create a double top…if it rallies through the 77 cent level it could be seen as a bullish breakout. The CAD has a historical correlation with commodity indices which have trended lower since 2011…when CAD hit a high of 1.05. If commodities are going higher then CAD might also rally.</p>

The weather change for more precipitation should bring in humidity which will be ideal for the corn crop. Traders are also looking ahead to Tuesday's USDA Grains Stocks and Planted Acreage data. Analysts polled by Reuters expect a slight shift in plantings from corn to soybeans and the second-largest June 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;soybean supply on record. Another factor in yesterday's drop was the International Grains Council raising its forecast for global corn and wheat production. Tuesday is First Notice Day on all July Grain contracts. In the overnight electronic session the July Corn is currently trading at 318 ¼ which is 1 cent higher. The trading range has been 319 ½ to&nbsp; 316 ¼.</p>

Their reasoning is OPEC+ cut deals to curtail supply and producers slashed capital expenditure. We also are coming into the 4<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;of July weekend, where we should see more cars and SUV’s on the road. The naysayers to this optimism are skeptical that demand will recover to pre-coronavirus levels anytime soon.

<p>And when people familiar with China's grains demand indicated on Wednesday—albeit through Bloomberg—that Beijing will import at least $20 billion of U.S. agricultural products a year if the two countries sign that partial trade deal suggested earlier this month, how did the soybeans and corn markets react?</p>
<p>“Blah”—that’s how. </p>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc34ad627e4b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">Corn</a></span> prices edged deeper into the red in Chicago trading on Wednesday, while those of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34ad62815f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span> managed to finish just in the positive.

<p></p><h3 dir=""ltr""><strong>China Buying More U.S. Ags? Data Validates Media Suggestions</strong></h3>
<p>With the soy and corn story though, more surprising was that there was affirmation to some extent on Thursday that the signals to Bloomberg by Chinese agricultural sources probably contained more than a grain of truth.</p>
<p>That validation came from none other than the U.S. Agriculture Department. The USDA released data showing that private exporters sold 264,000 tonnes of U.S. soybeans to China for delivery in the 2019/20 marketing year, amid hopes for the partial trade deal between the two sides.</p>
<p>Reuters reported that it was the first U.S. government confirmation of a soybean sale to China since President Donald Trump said on Oct. 11 that Beijing would buy up to $50 billion in American farm products as part of a trade agreement.</p>
<p>An earlier USDA report showed total U.S. soybean export sales of 475,200 tonnes, including just 68,300 tonnes to China, in the week ended on Oct. 17, Reuters noted. </p>
<p>Analysts' forecasts for the weekly report had ranged from 800,000 tonnes to 1.6 million tonnes.</p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><strong>Lack Of Ags Market Moves Looks Jarring To Some </strong></h3><p></p>
<p>The Hueber Report in St Charles, Illinois, which covers the daily moves in ags commodities, could not hide its disbelief at the lackluster performance of the soy and corn markets over the past two days despite the talk and data over higher Chinese demand.</p>
<p>Hueber Report analyst Kelley Herwig remarked that Thursday was “a rather uneventful day in grains”.</p>
<p>Wrote Herwig:</p>
<p></p><blockquote><p></p>
<p>“Overnight, China said they had agreed to purchase $20 billion worth of U.S, ags products as part of the first phase of the trade deal expected to be signed in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>China started to follow through with that statement this morning, with a spot export sale of 264,000 metric tonnes of soybeans for delivery in the current 2019/20 marketing year.” </p></blockquote><p></p><div class=""outerEleWrapper"">

<p>Yet, soybean prices were unable to hold their strength into Thursday’s close, with the benchmark January contract closing a half cent down at $9.47 per bushel, she noted.</p>

	</div>
</div><p>Likewise, corn started Thursday higher on the USDA report on China before slipping by the close, Herwig said.</p>
<p></p><blockquote>“Like soybeans, corn has traded sideways over the past several days and it wouldn’t be surprising to see a pull back in this market either. Support is near $3.8025 and $3.73”</blockquote><p></p>
<p>If not for the partial trade deal being pursued by the two sides, China might have little reason to buy more U.S. corn and soy now as animal feed, given the wholesale damage to its hog population caused by the African swine fever.</p>
<p></p><h3 dir=""ltr""><strong>From No Let Up In Trade War, The Two Sides Are Now Talking Again</strong></h3><p></p>
<p>Just before October, there seemed to be no let up in the tariffs battle between the two world powers, with the Trump administration applying duties on $550 billion of Chinese goods. The Xi Jinping administration, on its part, had tariffs on $185 billion of U.S. products.</p>
<p>Beijing had also imposed hefty duties on imports of U.S. pork as part of the trade war.</p>
<p>Despite the damage to its hog population, China's total purchases of U.S. pork last week stood at 2,002 tonnes—the smallest in five weeks. That was down from record-large weekly purchases of 152,599 tonnes reported in the week ended on Oct. 10, although USDA said sales from previous weeks may have been included.</p>
<p>Jack Scoville, who writes the daily ags report for the Price Futures Group in Chicago, said the cautious moves in soy and corn over the past two days could just be a a “wait-and-see” attitude by ags traders. </p>
<p></p><blockquote>“The problem is that the issues to be resolved are big and very complicated and will require a lot of time and work before success can be claimed by both sides.""</blockquote><p></p>
<p></p><p>But Scoville also notes that China has removed tariffs on up to 3 million tonnes of U.S. soybean imports by private industry as a show of good will towards the talks.</p><p></p>
<p></p><blockquote>“The good thing is, the two sides are talking again.”</blockquote><p></p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

The weather is playing a key factor with prospects of better yields and the export market picking up with a shrinking US dollar. Many analysts believe the next two weeks of near-normal temperatures with rains will be beneficial to the crops development. Funds remain short and we may see &nbsp;more selling pressure, unless we have a better than expected Export Sales data which analysts are already expecting signs of a solid number. December corn is currently trading at 326 ¼ which is unchanged. The trading range has been 328 to 326 ¼.</p>
<p>The Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that production averaged 958,000 barrels a day, which was up 50,000 on the week, but 73,000 barrels below last year because of lower demand caused by the pandemic and poor margins for producers. Blending demand was modestly higher, but also considerably lower than a year ago.</p>
<p>Stocks were up 471,000 barrels more than last week three and a half year low of 20.272 million barrels, but that is still 4.196 million barrels less than last year because of the slowdown in production. The next USDA corn for ethanol use is Wednesday August 12, with Crop Production USDA Supply/Demand, WASDE and EIA Energy Stocks &nbsp;data all out on the same day. There were no trades posted in the overnight electronic session. The September contract settled at 1.111 and is currently showing 3 bids @ 1.030 and 1 offer @ 1.180 with Open Interest at 69 contracts.</p>

We are trading lower at the moment, with Tropical Storm Isaias cone changing in the latest forecast, which has its path moving right through the state of Florida and moving up the Eastern Coast with minimal if any chance to enter the Gulf of Mexico. As we have seen in the past these storms are very unpredictable and could change course in an eyelash blink in a moment.</p>
<p>But that is the prediction for now, until we got the latest update from the National Hurricane Center’s tracking of the storm. And now we are seeing risk-off come into play. We are still not out of the woods in this active hurricane season, with a new disturbance located about 300 miles south-southeast of the Cabo Verde Islands which has become more concentrated this morning, and could develop further in the next day or two and at the current time has a 20% chance of Cyclone Formation.

They countered that that may be true by February, but prices in this commodity could go negative by September, with declines in orders still rampant and the fears of not if, but how many, cancellation of existing orders there will be.

Did I just say that??</p>
<p>There are a host of reasons for gold's gains: most immediately, the safe haven factor hedging against a second wave of the virus in Europe and a steadily worse primary situation in the US. However, looking at gold's correlations and its relationship with the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/us-spx-500"" id=""5fc34cf5212f5"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""166"">S&amp;P</a></span> is patchy at best— it can be both positively and negatively-correlated; it depends upon the circumstances of the moment.</p>
<p>With the Fed expected to run overtly dovish, it benefits both stock and gold markets alike as the "" liquidity on"" rally endures. It does not get much better than that.<br> <br>Given there is scope for the Republican recovery bill proposal, currently at $1 trillion, to expand significantly where a middle ground of $2 trillion would sound about right. Risk markets continue to soak in the lather of government stimulus and a Fed that's about to wax as dovish as dovish can get.<br> <br>As for the US dollar, the main risks to further near-term USD weakness include a COVID-19 vaccine that quickly normalizes expectations for US economic underperformance, a less dovish-than-expected FOMC outcome, or the US Congress passing a 2 + trn stimulus bill.<br> <br>Yield-curve control is probably not needed, but worth mentioning, mainly to keep bond yields in check of if inflation moves higher as <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc34cf5213fe"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">oil</a></span> prices firm. The consensus on the FOMC about this issue has not been reached yet. A firmer commitment towards allowing above-target inflation to happen before raising interest rates could further pressure real yields lower, undermining the dollar and pushing gold higher.</p>
<p>The risk to this view is the absence of any material forward guidance from the Fed that they will allow the economy to run hotter could drive real yields higher.</p>
<p>US equities were stronger Monday<strong>, </strong>S&amp;P up 0.7% following modest losses through Europe, and a mixed session in Asia. US <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/rates-bonds/u.s.-10-year-bond-yield"" id=""5fc34cf521524"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""23705"">10-Y</a></span> yields rose 3bps to 0.62%. A rebound in tech stocks led the US market higher, ahead of major tech company earnings reports later this week. Gold prices fell slightly for a record close. The recent rally in gold has been aided at least partly by US dollar weakness and escalating US-China tensions. <br> <br>US Senate Republicans have unveiled their long-anticipated <a href=""https://axitrader.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9393e60e3fd0e887f20c2e7ee&amp;id=f004099c2b&amp;e=96d2097e1d"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-saferedirecturl=""https://www.google.com/url?q=https://axitrader.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u%3D9393e60e3fd0e887f20c2e7ee%26id%3Df004099c2b%26e%3D96d2097e1d&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1595994153529000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHIongRniVU2nauAxvHZxpfaQx3Aw"">$1tn virus relief proposal</a>, setting the scene for a significant knock em down drag em out affair with Democrats over the coming days. In fact, at writing House Majority leader Hoyer suggests the Republicans plan down to meet health and economic challenges. <br> <br>Yet after another midsummer weekend with investors steeping on CV-19 related headlines, there should be no surprise to see Tech and the Stay-at-Home basket leading the charge higher. With COVID-related headlines via Major League Baseball games delays, and Google commentary about working from home until 2021 sees money rotate into Growth/Quality and out of Value. Starting to see a similar pattern on Monday opens. <br> <br>As we get into the meat of the matter this week, the main highlights will likely be the FOMC forward guidance on Wednesday, along with a raft of earnings releases, including market leadership heavyweights Amazon (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/amazon-com-inc"" id=""5fc34cf521626"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""6435"">AMZN</a></span>), Apple (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/apple-computer-inc"" id=""5fc34cf521730"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""6408"">AAPL</a></span>), Alphabet (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/google-inc"" id=""5fc34cf521835"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""6369"">GOOGL</a></span>), and Facebook (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/facebook-inc"" id=""5fc34cf52193b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""26490"">FB</a></span>), how much appetite traders have to add on risk is probably limited. But this is not a typical market with so much health and economic headline risk so best to keep on your toes. <br> <br><strong>Currency markets </strong><br> <br>Risk generally, is carrying on where it left off last week—bid. It seems like the market is ignoring the surge in COVID cases in Spain and focusing on the European recovery story after a durable <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/german-ifo-business-climate-index-132"" id=""5fc34cf521f4e"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""132"">German Ifo</a></span> print on Monday.<br> <br>The USD faces an uncertain time amid a growing focus on US policy stimulus. But it certainly feels that G-10 traders are morphing into selling the USD against the currency of their choice mode, making a currency analyst job quite easy.<br> <br><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/eur-usd"" id=""5fc34cf521a3f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""1"">EUR/USD</a></span> has pushed above 1.17, helped by a better IFO reading, but mostly reflects USD weakness. But recent ECB rhetoric reflects some internal divisions around the merits of the EU recovery fund. Euroscepticism is starting to gather and likely the reason we are not trading above 1.1800. Indeed, this will be a crucial level for markets over the near term. <br> <br> <br><strong>Gold market</strong><br> <br>Gold has moved through its all-time highs, setting a new high-water mark in 1965 this morning. In the main, the story continues to be Federal Reserve money printing coupled with the quarrels over USD1 trn fiscal stimulus package for pandemic relief.<br> <br> Gold is jumping in Asian trading hours again and is taking the rest of the precious metals complex higher. <br> <br>The latest surge in demand out of China suggests gold could easily break $2000, maybe even by the end of the week. US-China relationship strains further; concerns about inflation as oil prices firm up alongside the broad US dollar weakness which has gathered up speed. All of which makes for a perfect complimentary basket of drivers to push gold higher.<br> <br>Some real concerns are seeping back into the fray that the eventual path of US-China friction will lead to a flat-out war on capital. This view is not new and dates back to the start of the recent intensification of President Donald Trump's hard-line on China. It has included wide-ranging grab barrels of policies and proposals that touch on everything from student visas to <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34cf521b3c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybean</a></span> purchases. But the most explosive might be the suggestion floated by some the US administration China hawks that the US could choose to default on some of the nearly $1.1 trillion in US Treasury bonds held by China.<br> <br>Back in June Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a close Trump ally, said on Fox News, ""They should be paying us, not us paying China,"" and expressed support for a suggestion from Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., that the US should cancel its sovereign debt held by China.</p>
<p><strong><em>News flow triggered the oil market which made a full round trip yesterday</em>.</strong></p>
<p>US healthcare adviser Fauci told Fox News that he is optimistic about the Moderna (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/moderna"" id=""5fc34cf521c29"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""1114321"">MRNA</a></span>) vaccine. Indeed, this is positive in the sense that immunization is a one-stop recession stopper.</p>
<p>At the same time, Senate Republicans unveiled piecemeal portions of the new CV-19 relief proposal, which confirms the expected reduction of weekly unemployment benefit supplement to $200 from the current $600/wk<em>. </em>However, Senator McConnell was quick to throw the ball back in the Democrats' court, stating the proposal is ""a starting place, can not pass without Democrats.""</p>
<p>So we are still in the lurch with thee days left before the benefits expire, but people will undoubtedly notice the $ 400 drop-in their weekly stipend.</p>
<p>A series of different bits of news flow saw the oil market make a full round trip yesterday—reported infections and fatalities fell in several US states. In New York City, originally the epicenter of the US-based COVID crisis, case counts, hospitalizations, and COVID-related deaths have fallen back to early March levels.</p>
<p>Still, global CV-19 outbreaks threaten to derail demand recovery. The UK placed travelers from Spain back under quarantine orders over the weekend, for instance, as oil prices remain intricately linked to CV-19 news flows.</p>
<p>Oil markets are receiving support from expectations of the FOMC's firmer commitment in the upcoming policy meeting towards allowing above-target inflation to occur for some time, which should be viewed as incredibly positive for risk assets. And oil prices will continue to draw support from the Fed's dovish policy, which sees the US dollar move lower.  </p>
<p>Crude Oil continues to sit in narrow well-worn trading ranges as traded volumes fall into the summer. Ultimately something will shake the trees and knock us out of the range trade syndrome. </p>
<p>But for oil prices to break out higher, there must be a significant flattening of the US Sunbelt CV-19 case count curve at a minimum. Still, besides staying nervous over the absolute number of CV-19 case counts globally, traders have one eye trained on the US <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/crude-oil-inventories-75"" id=""5fc34cf522044"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""75"">supply</a></span> as the first weekly increase in the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/u.s.-baker-hughes-oil-rig-count-1652"" id=""5fc34cf522133"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1652"">US rig count</a></span> could be a sign of things to come.</p>
<p>Indeed, we may be bottoming out on the US supply side with weekly data showing that shut-in production is being returned while Friday's Baker Hughes rig count recorded a +1 rig count increases week-over-week. <em> </em></p>
<p><em>In my view traders, if they are indeed in the market, remain cautiously perched ahead of what could be a whippy few weeks, especially if they finally see proof of shut-in US production returning. And the moves could be exaggerated by summer trading conditions as liquidity will most likely taper into the August holiday season.</em></p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

With more talk of scattered showers with the heat will produce humidity and at night time temperatures in the mid to lower 70’s this is ideal growing conditions for corn for this time of year. And the started the profit-taking which had the market ending up lower on the day. Cash corn bids remained mostly steady in the Corn Belt but were a tad higher at a Decatur, Illinois processing facility. With Monday's Crop Progress, farmers will be concerned with booking new sales. Although, the farmers had optimism after last week's acreage report to see if corn could test $4, They were hoping by the 4<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;of July. We will just have to monitor how long this heat dome will last and also the drought index. December corn is currently trading at 351 ¼ which is 1 ¼ of a cent lower.

The Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient Rule eases restrictions through 2026, that initially were put in place by the Obama administration. But groups across the country say the EPA ignored the benefits that cleaner fuel brings to cars, including mid-level ethanol.</p>
<p>Mark Watne is president of the North Dakota Farmers Union and was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What it does is, it takes the need for increased octane and more improved emission-type fuel out of the equation. So it’s a really bad thing in that sense, because from a customer perspective, obviously you want the environment better and you want your vehicle to get better mileage, so it was a bad move.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Suhr went on to say several automakers including Ford (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/ford-motor-co"" id=""5fc352f2543d8"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""255"">F</a></span>) and Volkswagen (OTC:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/volkswagen-ag-pk"" id=""5fc352f2544b4"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""942278"">VWAPY</a></span>), say they’d prefer not to have the emission standards reduced from the 5% requirement originally set. And the news not only impacts those who grow the corn, but those who process it later down the line, they are also disappointed. There were no trades posted in the overnight electronic session. The August contract settled at 1.345 with the market currently showing 1 bid @ 1.271 and 1 offer @ 1.420 with Open Interest at 74 contracts.</p>

        <p>Investing.com - U.S. wheat futures tumbled on Monday, as much-needed rainfall in the U.S. grain belt eased concerns over the health of the winter-wheat crop.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc34596be255"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">US wheat</a></span> for May delivery hit a session low of $5.1340 a bushel, the weakest level since April 1, before trading at $5.1488 during U.S. morning hours, down 11.53 cents, or 2.19%.</p>
<p>On Friday, wheat jumped 7.6 cents, or 1.49%, to settle at $5.2640, drawing support from chart-based buying.</p>
<p>Agricultural meteorologists forecast further rains in key U.S. wheat-growing states, after much-needed rainfall fell over dry areas in the Great Plains-region over the weekend.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, nearly 44% of the U.S. winter wheat crop was rated good to excellent as of last week. The five-year average for the first week in April is 47%.</p>
<p>Later in the day, the USDA will release updated crop progress numbers for the week ended April 10.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc34596be672"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">US corn</a></span> for May delivery slumped 1.82 cents, or 0.49%, to trade at $3.7438 a bushel. Prices touched a daily low of $3.7288, a level not seen since March 20.</p>
<p>Corn declined 1.0 cent, or 0.26%, on Friday to end at $3.7700 amid indications of ample supplies.</p>
<p>The USDA said last week that U.S. corn inventories at the end of the 2014-15 season in August will total 1.827 billion bushels, up from a previous estimate of 1.777 billion bushels.</p>
<p>The agency also projected global ending corn stockpiles at 188.5 million metric tons for the 2014-15 season, up from a previous forecast of 185.28 million tons.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the Chicago Board of Trade, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34596be7ae"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">US soybeans</a></span> for May delivery eased down 0.57 cents, or 0.06%, to trade at $9.5163 a bushel.</p>
<p>On Friday, soybean prices tumbled to $9.4440, the lowest level since October 21, before closing at $9.5140, down 2.0 cents, or 0.21%, as optimism over the outlook for supplies in South America and weak demand for U.S. supplies drove down prices.</p>
<p>Prices of the oilseed lost 32.87 cents, or 3.34%, last week, the fifth weekly decline in the past six weeks.</p>
<p>According to the USDA, global soybean ending stocks were expected to total 89.6 million tons, up from 89.5 million tons estimated last month, due to a record crop in Brazil.</p>
<p>Brazil and Argentina are major soybean exporters and compete with the U.S. for business on the global market. Large South American crop prospects could weigh on demand for U.S. supplies.</p>
<p>Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, government figures show. Wheat was fourth, behind hay.</p>

<p>Once again the death of Chinese oil demand has been greatly exaggerated. Oil prices paused on U.S.-China trade concerns as well as potential interest rate direction from the Federal Reserve that <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/fed-interest-rate-decision-168"" id=""5fc34bb7efbfa"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""168"">meets</a></span> on Wednesday. Yet one must wonder how tight the global oil markets might get if there is indeed a U.S.-China trade deal because already Chinese oil demand is shattering records.</p>
<p>Reuters reports that the growth rate of Chinese <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc34bb7ef4d4"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">crude oil</a></span> imports reached a record 11.13 million barrels per day in November and are up 10.5% for the first 11 months of the year compared to the same period last year, customs data showed on Monday. This flies in the face of the bearish arguments that we had heard that the U.S.-China trade war would destroy Chinese oil demand. What is more is the fact that the OPEC plus alliance is committed to keeping global oil supply restrained leaving the global oil demand cover the tightest it has been in years.</p>
<p>The pressure on China to make a deal should be rising especially if you look at their <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cpi-743"" id=""5fc34bb7f00df"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""743"">Consumer Inflation Data</a></span> released last night. MarketWatch reported that, “China's consumer inflation accelerated further in November to its highest level in nearly eight years, driven by soaring prices of pork and other food items. The consumer-price index rose 4.5% in November from a year earlier, matching a pace recorded in January 2012, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed Tuesday. The key inflation reading was higher than a 3.8% rise in October and beat a median forecast of a 4.4% increase by economists in a Wall Street Journal poll.</p>
<p>China’s food prices in October grew 19.1% from a year earlier, the fastest pace in more than 11 years, after climbing 15.5% in October. Pork prices soared 110.2% a year in November, breaking the record made in October as an outbreak of African swine fever continued to cut the hog population and drive pork prices higher. Pork prices alone lifted headline CPI by 2.64 percentage points in November. Meanwhile, the increase in China pork prices on a monthly basis eased to 3.8% in November, down 16.3 percentage points from a month earlier. Prices for other meat consumed as pork alternatives rose between 11.8% to 25.7% on year in November, the statistics bureau said.</p>
<p>In addition to that or perhaps because of it, China is making good on some Phase one grain purchases. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34bb7ef8ff"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">Soybeans</a></span> moved higher after Reuters reported that Chinese soy importers on Monday bought at least five bulk cargo shipments of U.S. soybeans, or about 300,000 tonnes, for shipment in January and February after Beijing offered the buyers at least 1 million tonnes in new tariff waivers, U.S. exporters said. The fresh allotment of tariff waivers, which exempts importers from 30% tariffs on U.S. shipments, comes after buyers used up nearly all of the 10 million tonnes in waivers awarded by Beijing in October, the traders said. On top of that, we get the December WASDE report, and so far the market is not expecting any major changes from the last report. So stay tuned.</p>

<p>In the U.S., average cash prices fell to about $7.79 a bushel this week, the lowest in almost a decade, according to an index compiled by the Minneapolis Grain Exchange. China’s tariffs on American goods including farm products have now taken effect after the U.S. implemented a raft of duties earlier in the day Friday and President Trump threatened more action.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Brazil, exporters have been handed high times. Soybeans to be loaded in August at the nation’s Paranagua port fetched $2.21 a bushel more than Chicago futures as of Friday, the widest gap since data starts in 2014. The premium has more than tripled since the end of May, according to data from Commodity 3.</p>
<p>""Premiums reflect the rising possibility of China being more dependent on Brazil’s soybeans,"" Luis Fernando Roque, an analyst at consultancy firm Safras &amp; Mercado, said in a telephone interview from Porto Alegre.</p>
<p>How Trump’s Trade Fight Risks Upending Global Agriculture Flows</p>
<p>The rally means the added premium for Brazil supplies are equal to about two-thirds the cost of the tariffs China is planning to levy on U.S. shipments, according to a report from INTL FCStone.</p>
<p>So far, good crushing margins are helping to keep Chinese demand robust for Brazilian supplies, even with surging premiums. China bought about 1.1 million metric tons of soybeans from Brazil last week, while no purchases from the U.S. were reported, according to the China National Grain and Oils Information Center.</p>
<p>That’s an unusual move for this time of the year, when China usually starts booking U.S. supply in the months before the North American harvest starts. Supplies in Brazil begin to fall after shipments peak for the season in May.</p>

<p>U.S. contracts had initially pared losses after last weeks sharp decline, helped by the beneficial price effect of the White House's <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/news/stock-market-news/us-poised-to-lift-steel-aluminum-tariffs-from-canada-mexico-media-reports-1871832"" id=""5fc3481b9420d"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""oal"" data-articleid=""1871832"">move to lift metal tariffs</a></span> on Canadian and Mexican imports.</p>
<p>However, the rebound proved short-lived compared with the ramifications of last week's ban on Chinese telecom company Huawei, as other U.S. tech companies such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/qualcomm-inc"" id=""5fc3481b9065e"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""6376"">QCOM</a></span>) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/avago-technologies"" id=""5fc3481b90700"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""13969"">AVGO</a></span>) joined Alphabet in stopping all shipping from the Chinese smart phone giant.</p>
<p>Earlier, in the Asian session, regional indices closed well off their lows, as investors registered the likely election wins of conservative incumbent parties in Australia and India. Indias <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/s-p-cnx-nifty"" id=""5fc3481b907ad"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""17940"">Nifty 50</a></span> leaped 3.60%, only a few inches away from its record closing price posted on April 16.</p>

<p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picdc54fce55a4cafd2fe9648c585c405be.jpeg"" alt=""Shanghai Composite Daily Chart"" title=""Shanghai Composite Daily Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Shanghai Composite Daily Chart</span></div></div></div><p></p>

Technically, however, Chinese bulls are expected to get slaughtered as the price develops a rising, bearish flag, after topping out. Todays rebound was favored by the dual support of the 100 DMA on the bottom of the flag. Below lies in wait the 200 DMA. If prices fall below that, as the current pattern suggests, investors can expected to experience more pain.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the yield on <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/rates-bonds/u.s.-10-year-bond-yield"" id=""5fc3481b9097f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""23705"">10-year</a></span> Treasurys climbed for the third session out of four since touching the 2.350% level. We can call a bottom if it scaled above the 2.62% level, completing a double bottom.</p>
<p>Overall, if yields bottom out, they will also complete a massive falling, bullish wedgedemonstrating that all Treasury buyers have been pushed out, driving yields higher, and that the long-term uptrend since mid-2016 will resume after a medium-term interruption this year. However, until that happens, we remain bullish on bonds and defensive on equities.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/20/us-china-trade-uncertainty-is-the-enemy-of-growth-oecd-warns-as-it-slashes-forecasts-trade-tensions-between-the-us-and-china-stalled-a-global-recovery-and-are-continuing-to-endanger-investment-and-gro.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">slashed its economic forecasts</a>, warning against the visible effects of a protracted U.S.-China trade dispute.</p>

No doubt the Fed, which releases <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/fomc-meeting-minutes-108"" id=""5fc3481b92c8c"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""108"">minutes</a></span> from its last monetary policy meeting on Wednesday, will monitor the next batch of data closely to fine-tune its interest rate approach.</p>

Technically, the WTI price gave up its intraday highs, forming a shooting starwhich would only be confirmed by a closing priceand pointing at the resistance of its prior uptrend line since the December bottom. For now, the May 13 highs are providing a support. The black gold provided a positive signal last week when it triggered a golden cross, when the 50 DMA crossed over the 200 DMA.</p>

<p>Wheat production estimate was lowered in Canadas Principal field crop areas report. Will the wheat prices continue rising?</p>
<p>Statistics Canada reported wheat plantings at 24.595 million acres on June 26, down 0.6% from 2018. This area is below a prior estimate of 25-26 million acres. Canada is worlds seventh top wheat producer, and what is more important the second biggest wheat exporter: Canada exported $5.7 billion worth of wheat during 2018, accounting for 14.2% of global wheat exports in 2018. Lower Canadian wheat production estimate is bullish for wheat.</p>

<p>On the daily timeframe the <strong>WEHAT: D1</strong> is above the 200-day moving average MA(200), this is bullish.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Parabolic indicator</strong> gives a buy signal.</li>
<li>The <strong>Donchian channel </strong>indicates no trend yet: it is flat.</li>
<li>The MACD indicator gives a bearish signal: it is above the signal line and the gap is narrowing.</li>
<li>The RSI oscillator has levelled off and has not reached the oversold zone yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe the bullish momentum will continue after the price breaches above the upper boundary of Donchian channel at 556.1. This level can be used as an entry point for placing a pending order to buy. The stop loss can be placed below the last fractal low at 517.5. After placing the order, the stop loss is to be moved every day to the next fractal low, following Parabolic signals. Thus, we are changing the expected profit/loss ratio to the breakeven point. If the price meets the stop loss level (517.5) without reaching the order (556.1), we recommend cancelling the order: the market has undergone internal changes which were not taken into account.</p>

<p>The lack of upward momentum last month saw speculative investors reducing their net long positions for a second consecutive week in the week to May 28, according to the latest data snapshot from CFTC.</p>
<p>In contrast,<strong> SILVER</strong> continues to underperform as it slowly attempts a rebound from the 2019 lows hit a week ago. It is edging toward the 200-day moving average resistance at 14.9104 while the 55-day moving average sits at 14.9168. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/silver"" id=""5fc3483c532c6"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8836"">Silver</a></span> is now at 14.8001. The gold/silver (Mint) ratio has risen to record highs this week amid golds better bid tone.

Net shorts are now at the highest since September last year.</p>
<p><strong>PLATINUM</strong> saw the biggest one-day gain in two months yesterday as the US dollar retreated. The rebound came as the metal posted the biggest monthly loss since August 2016 last month. The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/platinum"" id=""5fc3483c53378"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8910""> precious metal</a></span> is now at 823.17 and looks poised to test the 200-day moving average at 828.86 for the first time since May 17.</p>

<h3><strong>Base metals</strong></h3>
<p>Weakening global growth prospects continue to pressure <strong>COPPER</strong> prices with a protracted, escalating US-China trade war implying slower global growth and hence slackening demand for industrial metals.

<p><strong>SILVER</strong> is consolidating the biggest one-day gain in almost two months made last Friday and is sitting just below the 200-day moving average at 14.9366. Speculative investors turned net buyers for the first time in three weeks, according to <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-silver-speculative-net-positions-1621"" id=""5fc34803b92ad"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1621"">CFTC</a></span> data as at April 30. Bloomberg notes that Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) increased holdings of silver by the most since February 14 last Friday.</p>

<p><strong>PLATINUM</strong> is on a three-day rising streak as it rebounds from five-week lows. Reports that a South African <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/platinum"" id=""5fc34803b8dee"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8910"">platinum</a></span> mine was forced to close for a safety inspection following an incident that trapped 1,800 miners underground raised concerns about the supply side. The price differential between platinum and palladium has narrowed to $466 from $741 in March.</p>
<p>Speculative investors remain bullish on the commodity, with net long positioning at its highest in 15 months, according to the latest data snapshot from CFTC.</p>
<p><strong>PALLADIUM</strong> remains in consolidation mode after falling to a four-month low last week, which represented an almost 19% drop from the record high seen in March. Bullish speculative investors have not thrown in the towel just yet, adding to net long positions for a second consecutive week, according to the latest data snapshot from CFTC as at April 30.</p>
<h3><strong>Base metals</strong></h3>
<p><strong>COPPER</strong> prices remain surprisingly resilient considering the negative sentiment surrounding the US-China trade negotiations this week. Prices touched the lowest since January 30 yesterday in a knee-jerk reaction to the Trump tariff threat but rebounded strongly to close in the black. The rebound ensured that prices remained above the 200-day moving average at 2.7599 on a closing basis. That moving average has supported prices since February 15.</p>

<h3><strong>Energy</strong></h3>
<p><strong>NATURAL GAS</strong> prices remain subdued, hovering just above 2-1/2 year lows amid slackening demand with cooler weather across the US expected for the next week, reducing demand for gas for air-conditioning. Optimistic bulls may find some comfort in the fact that gas stockpiles are below normal levels for this time of year, though weekly <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/eia-weekly-distillates-stocks-917"" id=""5fc34803b940c"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""917"">EIA</a></span> data has been showing that stockpiles have been building up over the past five weeks, with last weeks increase the most since June 2015.</p>
<p><strong>CRUDE OIL</strong> prices have been volatile at the start of this week, under pressure initially following Trumps tariff threat at the weekend, but recovering late in the day on news from the US Department of Defence that it would be deploying a carrier group to the Middle East as a deterrent to Iran amid alleged evidence of an escalation in activity there.</p>
<p>West Texas Intermediate (<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc34803b8f49"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">WTI</a></span>) posted a second consecutive weekly decline last week, the first time since December. Yesterdays down-move saw WTI trade below the 200-day moving average at $60.638 for the first time since April 2 and trade below $60 per barrel for the first time since April 1. The 55-day moving average continued to support at $60.303. Prices have closed above this moving average since January 17.</p>
<p>News that Saudi Arabia announced that it was cutting June pricing for all crude shipments to the US could keep the current rebound capped. It is unsure whether this was done to placate US President Trump and his comments that oil prices were too high, or for other reasons.</p>

<h3><strong>Agriculture</strong></h3>
<p><strong>WHEAT</strong> prices are hovering near 15-month lows amid expectations of solid supply. The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc34803b8ffc"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">Wheat</a></span> Quality Council had its annual crop review and reported that crop yields across Kansas were very solid. In addition to the potential oversupply situation, Trumps tariff threat could see an escalation in the trade war and heap additional pressure on the agricultural sector.</p>
<p>Speculative investors are the most bearish on wheat since January last year and increased their net short positions for a third straight week to April 30, according to the latest <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-wheat-speculative-net-positions-1812"" id=""5fc34803b94a9"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1812"">CFTC</a></span> data.</p>
<p><strong>SUGAR</strong> prices closed at the lowest level in four months on Friday after India announced that its output for the season just ended on April 30 rose to 33 million tons, up from 32.5 million tons the previous season, and the highest on record. Prices have now fallen for two consecutive weeks and speculative investors turned net bearish on the commodity for the first time in seven weeks to April 30, the latest data from CFTC shows. Markets were closed yesterday due to a UK bank holiday.</p>
<p>News that wet weather across the US Midwest may delay the<strong> CORN</strong> planting schedule could not help corn prices at the start of this week. Prices look set to fall for a second straight day today after failing to overcome the 200-day moving average at 3.594. The moving average has capped prices on a closing basis since April 4. Speculative investors are heavily bearish, having been net sellers for the past five weeks and boosting bearish bets to the highest since March 1996.</p>
<p><strong>SOYBEANS</strong> look set for a fifth weekly loss this week, matching the longest stretch seen last May-June. Prices touched a more than a decade low yesterday following Trumps weekend tweet, given that <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34803b90a8"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span> were the first commodity to be hit when the trade wars began. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-soybeans-speculative-net-positions-1811"" id=""5fc34803b9548"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1811"">Speculative</a></span> investors appear to expect further losses as net short positioning has reached its highest since September 1997.</p>

Will the rice prices fall?</p>
<p>On Wednesday, July 19, 2017, the Chinese National Grain Trade Center announced the sale of 124.8 thousand tonnes of rice from the state reserves. This volume is 7.7% of the 1.62 mln tonnes declared at the auction. The rice sale from the Chinese state reserves will continue. In the 2017/18 agricultural season, India increased the planting acreage of rice to 12.58 mln hectares, which is by 4.6% more than in the previous season. Note that last week the rice prices dropped by about 5% in India and Thailand. This is connected with the reduction in global demand and competition with other producer countries.</p>
<p>In particular, Vietnam increased the rice exports by 10.3% to 2.9 mln tonnes in the first half of this year. Egypt expects an increase in rice crops to 6.5 mln tonnes this year, compared with 5.1 mln tonnes of the last year. The main buyers of rice in Southeast Asia are the Philippines, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka.</p>

<p>On the daily timeframe, <b>Rice: D1</b> is trying to return to the rising price channel. The continuation of the downward correction is possible in case of an increase in rice supply in the world market.</p>
<ul><li>The Parabolic indicator gives a bearish signal.</li>
<li>The Bollinger bands have widened, which means high volatility.</li>
<li>The <a href=""https://www.ifcmarkets.com/en/ntx-indicators/rsi"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">RSI</a> is above 50. It has formed a weak negative divergence.</li>
<li>The <a href=""https://www.ifcmarkets.com/en/ntx-indicators/macd"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">MACD</a> gives a bearish signal.</li>
</ul><p><br>The bearish momentum may develop in case <b>Rice</b> drops below the last low at 11.58. This level may serve as an entry point. The initial stop loss may be placed above the two last fractal highs, the Parabolic signal and the record high since November, 2015 at 12.22. After opening the pending order, we shall move the stop to the next fractal high following the Bollinger and Parabolic signals. Thus, we are changing the potential profit/loss to the breakeven point.</p>
<p>More risk-averse traders may switch to the 4-hour chart after the trade and place there a stop loss moving it in the direction of the trade. If the price meets the stop level at 12.22 without reaching the order at 11.58 we recommend cancelling the position: the market sustains internal changes that were not taken into account.</p>

<p>The spread of the coronavirus is pressuring <strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc348c495a3c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">Crude Oil</a></span></strong> prices amid expectations that the impact could affect global growth projections as Chinese companies remain closed for an extended period. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) hit levels not seen in more than a year in early trading this morning, and the decline has sparked speculation that OPEC may convene an extraordinary meeting to address the trend, with rumours circulating of a Feb. 4-5 gathering.</p>
<p>As a result of the virus, Bloomberg estimated that Chinas oil demand has dropped by three million barrels, or about 20%, the biggest shock to demand since the Global Financial Crisis in 2008/09. The number of U.S. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/u.s.-baker-hughes-oil-rig-count-1652"" id=""5fc348c49644f"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1652"">oil rigs</a></span> in production tailed off last week, the first decline in three weeks.</p>
<p>Speculative investors reduced net long positions for a third consecutive week to January 28, according to the latest data snapshot from CFTC. Net longs are now at the lowest since the week of Dec. 3.</p>
<p>WTI fell for a fourth consecutive day yesterday as the number of confirmed coronavirus climbed above 20,000 globally and the number of deaths has risen to 426, an attrition rate of about 2%. The 100- and 200-day moving averages have converged just above the $57.00 mark.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/natural-gas"" id=""5fc348c495c6e"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8862"">Natural Gas</a></span></strong> prices remain under pressure despite forecasts of colder-than-normal temperatures in the U.S. for the Feb. 10-15 period. Prices are languishing near four-year lows with the 55-, 100- and 200-day moving averages all tending lower.</p>
<p>Speculators remain bearish on the commodity, with net short positioning matching the highs seen in June 2015. Data from the Energy Information Administration released last week showed a reduction of 201 billion cubic feet (bcf) in stockpiles, the biggest drop since March last year.</p>
<h2><strong> </strong><strong>Precious metals</strong></h2><p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc348c495d3b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">Gold</a></span></strong> remains supported by the desire to hold safe haven assets during this virus period, but has so far lacked the momentum to maintain any break above the psychological 1,600 level. The metal advanced during December and January but is so far trading negatively this month.</p>
<p>Speculative accounts remain solidly bullish on gold however, increasing net long positions to the most since records began in 1993. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) increased their gold holdings for an eighth consecutive session as at yesterday, according to Bloomberg reports, bringing net purchases for the year to 730,000 ounces.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/silver"" id=""5fc348c495de8"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8836"">Silver</a></span></strong> likewise has struggled to keep its upward trajectory during 2020 after reaching a near-term peak on January 8. Its still maintaining a foothold above the 55-day moving average at 17.477 and that moving average has supported prices on a closing basis since Dec. 20.</p>
<p>The lack of upward momentum has tested the patience of silver bulls and speculative investors have reduced net long positions to the least in four weeks, according to CFTC data.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/palladium"" id=""5fc348c495e9d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8883"">Palladium</a></span></strong> is consolidating last weeks drop which saw prices fall to the lowest in a week and more than 10% off the Jan. 21 peak. The recent decline has seen some speculative investors rush to book profits and net long positioning has been scaled back over the last three weeks to the lowest levels since the week of Sept. 11, the latest CFTC reports shows.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/platinum"" id=""5fc348c495f81"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8910"">Platinum</a></span></strong> touched a 3-1/2 week low yesterday as global slowdown fears prompted concerns that industrial demand for the metal could wane. The 55-day moving average at 948.52 remains intact as support and prices have held above it since Dec. 10. Speculative investors remain bullish however, with net long positioning as of Jan. 28 at the highest levels since records began in 1993, according to the latest data from CFTC.</p><!--start-image-->

In the 10 days from Jan. 20, the metal has fallen 12.5% and reached levels now seen since Sept. 3. As at Jan. 28, speculative accounts turned net bearish on the metal for the first time in three weeks, according to CFTC data.</p>

The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that U.S. corn exports were up 23% on the week to Jan.y 23, with demand coming from Mexico, Japan, Colombia and Guatemala.</p>
<p>The projected <strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-sugar-no11"" id=""5fc348c496194"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8869"">Sugar</a></span></strong> shortage for this season is keeping prices buoyant, hitting the highest level since January 2018 yesterday. Prices are nearing the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the September 2016 to August 2018 decline at 0.1508. Thats also close to the 200-month moving average at 0.1516.</p>
<p>Adding to the global shortage, India forecast that its 2019/20 sugar output would fall 17% to 27.4 million tons. Speculative accounts remain bullish on the commodity, lifting net long positions to the highest since March 2017, CFTC data show.</p><!--start-image-->

Previously they lost 10% from mid-December amid favorable weather and stricter import regulations of grain to Egypt. Last week the weather has turned nasty, which caused the massive closure of the shorts. For the last week of 2015, the volume of shorts closed up almost 40%, according to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Will the wheat prices continue rising?</p>
<p>Market participants have opened many shorts in wheat hoping for the continued spell of fine weather in the United States but it did not happen. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has revised downwards the winter wheat seedlings rated in good and excellent condition in Illinois on December 31 to 58% from 67% on November 29. Nine people died in flood in Illinois. The depreciated seedlings quality triggered the shorts closure and the further wheat prices growth.

<p>On the daily chart <b>Wheat: D1</b> is moving sideways. A couple of days ago the attempt of breaking through its support failed but the wheat hit new record low since mid-2010. Now they are slightly moving upwards. The Parabolic indicator and MACD give buy signals. The Bollinger bands? have contracted which may mean lower volatility. RSI has formed positive divergence. It has not yet reached the overbought zone but surpassed the level of 50. The bullish momentum may develop in case wheat prices surpass the last fractal high and the Parabolic signal at 482. This level may serve the point of entry. The initial risk-limit may be placed below the sideways trend support, the last fractal low, the 5 ? year low and Parabolic signal at 458. Having opened the pending order we shall move the stop to the next fractal low following the Parabolic and Bollinger signals. Thus, we are changing the probable profit/loss ratio to the breakeven point. The most risk-averse traders may switch to the 4-hour chart after the trade and place there a stop-loss moving it in the direction of the trade. If the price meets the stop-loss level at 458 without reaching the order at 482, we recommend cancelling the position: the market sustains internal changes which were not taken into account.</p>

</ul>
<p>The bullish momentum may develop in case <strong>OATS</strong> exceed their last high at 281.5. This level may serve as an entry point. The initial stop loss may be placed below the two last fractal lows, the lower Bollinger band, the 200-day moving average line and the Parabolic signal at 258.5. After opening the pending order, we shall move the stop to the next fractal low following the Bollinger and Parabolic signals. Thus, we are changing the potential profit/loss to the breakeven point. More risk-averse traders may switch to the 4-hour chart after the trade and place there a stop loss moving it in the direction of the trade. If the price meets the stop level (258.5) without reaching the order (281.5), we recommend to close the position: the market sustains internal changes that were not taken into account.</p>

<p>Possibly lending additional support is news that Chinas sugarcane growing areas are facing heavy rains and flooding this week, according to the local meteorological centre, which could impact crops. Thailands Cane and Sugar Board announced that sugar output for the November 20 to April 15 period was 14.4 million tons, which was derived from 129.7 million tons of sugarcane.</p>
<p>Speculative positioning in sugar turned net long for the first time since the week of February 26, the latest CFTC data shows, as investors completed six straight weeks of net buying.</p>

</div><p><strong>SILVER</strong> jumped the most in almost three weeks yesterday on trade talk hopes and has extended those gains this morning to reach the highest since September 6. Silvers relative out-performance also pushed the gold/silver (Mint) ratio down to the lowest since September 6.</p>
<p>Speculative accounts were not expecting this rally, having reduced net long positions for a second week in the week to September 17. Net longs are now at the lowest in four weeks.</p>

The metal looks set to rise for an eighth consecutive week after pausing between March and August. A combination of tight supply and a more positive outlook for global car demand once the US and China agree a trade deal pulled prices higher.</p>
<p>Speculative accounts added to net long positions for a second straight week in the week to September 17, and they are now the highest since the week of July 30.</p>

Speculative investors appear not to be convinced that the metal has further upside as they turned net sellers in the week to September 17, according to the latest CFTC report, pulling net longs from a six-month high.</p>

Optimism surrounding US-China trade talks drove the rebound amid hopes for an earlier-than-expected round of high-level talks. Speculative investors scaled back their net short positions for a second week, CFTC data to September 17 show.</p>

Tensions in the Gulf remain high, though as yet there has been no aggressive response from either Saudi Arabia or its allies.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia was quick to assure the market that almost all of the facilities would be back to near full production by the end of this month, though those who have been tasked with making it happen have suggested it may take longer, according to reports from <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/us-30"" id=""5fc3487d40c5f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""169"">Dow</a></span> Jones.</p>
<p>Prices posted the biggest weekly gain since June last week after the attacks cut Saudi production and this has caused ratings agency Moodys to scale back its output forecast to 9.7 million barrels per day. As a result, it also lowered its forecast for Saudi Arabias 2019 growth to just 0.3% from 1.5% previously.</p>

The average increase in the 2014-2918 period was 74 billion bcf per week, according to Bloomberg calculations.</p>
<p>Speculative investors have been net buyers of the commodity for the past five weeks and net short positions, which have been in place since February 12, have been trimmed to the least since June 4.</p>
<p>Prices have failed to sustain a breach of the 200-day moving average, now at 2.626, on a closing basis that occurred on September 16 and prices have now retraced back below it.</p>

<h3><strong>Base metals</strong></h3>
<p>The uncertainty surrounding the next stage of U.S.-China trade talks at the end of this week, with the March 1 deadline fast approaching, has kept <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/copper"" id=""5fc347962d1df"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8831"">copper</a></span> prices under pressure for the last few sessions. Prices had reached a 4-1/2 month high late last week, but once again failed to breach resistance around the 2.8420 level. If the pressure continues for the rest of the week, copper faces its first weekly loss in six weeks. The 55-week moving average at 2.8668 looks poised to close below the 100-week moving average at 2.8723 for the first time since March 2017.</p>

<h3><strong>Precious metals</strong></h3>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc347962d3df"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">Gold</a></span> continues its retreat from 9-1/2 month highs as the U.S. dollar recaptures some of its safe haven status. Gold is still holding above the key 1,300 level, a level which proved to be a tough level to crack on the way up in January. It will now act as strong support. Gold is now trading at 1,308.25. Latest data from CFTC showed that <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-gold-speculative-net-positions-1618"" id=""5fc347962e6ef"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1618"">speculative investors</a></span> turned net sellers for the first time in six weeks in the week to Jan. 8.</p>
<p>Indias gold imports jumped 64% from a year earlier in January, despite local gold prices hitting their highest in more than five years, Bloomberg reports. The jump comes ahead of the popular wedding season, which runs from February to May.</p>
<p>IMF data shows that Kazakhstan increased its gold holdings by 2.81 million tonnes in January while central bank data showed China added 380,000 troy ounces to its reserves in the same month. Meanwhile, Italy is proposing a change to its constitution that will allow the government to sell the countrys gold reserves.</p>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/silver"" id=""5fc347962d49a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8836"">Silver</a></span> has fallen 2.3% since the beginning of the month as the U.S. dollar remains buoyant. The metal had touched a six-month high at the end of last month. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-silver-speculative-net-positions-1621"" id=""5fc347962ec74"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1621"">Speculative accounts</a></span> seem convinced the up-move has more legs as latest CFTC data as of Jan. 8 shows net long positioning at its highest since November 2017.</p>
<p>ETF holdings of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/platinum"" id=""5fc347962d552"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8910"">platinum</a></span> reached 2.61 million ounces last week, the highest since November 2015, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. However, speculative accounts reduced their net long holdings for the first time in four weeks in the week to Jan. 8, according to CFTC data.</p>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/palladium"" id=""5fc347962d5fd"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8883"">Palladium</a></span> remains in consolidation after hitting record highs in January, still supported by the metrics of strong demand and limited supply. Palladium is now trading at 1,388.85 after hitting 1,440 in January. Speculative investors are still bullish, net buyers for a second straight week to Jan. 8 with net long positioning near 11-month highs, according to the latest CFTC data.</p>
<h3><strong>Energy</strong></h3>
<p>Last week <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc347962d6a5"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">crude oil</a></span> suffered its worst weekly loss this year, and struggled in the early part of yesterday amid concerns about the U.S.-China trade talks at the end of this week. WTI fell as much as 2.8% to a two-week low of $51.17 per barrel before rebounding strongly into the close, as OPEC cuts and Venezuela sanctions overcame the selling pressure. WTI held above the 55-day moving average at $50.855, as it has on a closing basis since Jan. 17. Later today <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/api-weekly-crude-oil-stock-656"" id=""5fc347962ed3b"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""656"">API</a></span> releases weekly crude oil inventory data, which has shown an increase in oil stockpiles for the past three weeks.</p>

<h3><strong>Agriculturals</strong></h3>
<p>In its shutdown-delayed World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report last Friday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture raised its outlook for <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc347962d7d7"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">wheat</a></span> reserves while keeping the exports forecast unchanged for the current season. Russian exports are seen slowing as domestic prices rise, making Russian wheat less competitive. Meanwhile, Egypt, the worlds biggest wheat importer, bought two consignments of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc347962d884"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">U.S. wheat</a></span> last Friday, the first time it had done so since November.</p>
<p>Prices were at the months lows when the report was published, and have since staged a mild recovery, holding above the confluence of three moving averages, the 55, 200 and 100 averages, in the 5.0748-5.0324 window. Prices are now at 5.144.</p>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-sugar-no11"" id=""5fc347962d926"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8869"">Sugar</a></span> looks poised for its third daily loss in a row despite some possible supply disruptions in the future. Australian sugar cane producers in Northern Queensland are hoping that heavy flooding that has devastated thousands of hectares in the growing region will not hurt the crop harvest too much.</p>
<p>Non-commercial net short positioning in sugar increased for a fourth straight week in the week to Jan. 8, and is now at the most since the week of Oct. 3, according to delayed CFTC data.</p>
<p>Argentinas <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc347962d9d2"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">corn</a></span> harvest for the current season is seen at a record level of 46 million tons, an 8% increase from the previous season, as abundant rains and benign temperatures boost crop yields. Corn prices have fallen for the past four days, though this could stop today as the 55-day moving average at 3.6917 holds on a closing basis. Corn is now at 3.702.</p>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc347962da7c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">Soybeans</a></span> are facing a third weekly loss after the USDA trimmed its outlook for China soybean demand in its latest WASDE report published last Friday. There is rising trendline support from the September low on the weekly chart, which comes in at 8.946 this week, while the 55-week moving average at 9.2272 acts as interim resistance.</p>

The Pink Sheet is a monthly statistical report on prices of major agricultural commodities, metals and minerals, energy and fertilizers (<b>1960-2016</b>). Monthly prices for the series are published at the beginning of each month. The prices are positively correlated with the futures prices (Column <b>2</b> of the Table).</p>
<p>The previous forecasts performed rather well: the Mean of Absolute Errors expressed in percentages was <b>3.64</b> while the number of correct trends lowered. Because of both high positive correlation and accuracy of forecasted values it could be recommended to check the values provided in this article. They can be used for identifying price trends for commodity futures. The monthly commodity prices in nominal US dollars over the period from<b> </b><strong>December 2015 to April 2016</strong> (World Banks Pink Sheets) and forecasted period (Authors Calculations) for <b>May 2016</b> are presented in tables below (futures related commodities are presented only).</p>
<p>The Pink Sheets for May<b> 2016</b> will be released on <strong>June 3, 2016.</strong> Forecasts are projected with an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model based on monthly historical data that is relevant for calculations. Commodities are placed in alphabetical order. Forecasted values: increase in green; decrease in red. It is advised to use forecasted values for identifying the short-term price trends over the period firstly. Because of lowered accuracy in forecasting price trends, some ARIMA models have been corrected.</p>

<p>The El Nino weather phenomenon may have a negative effect on <a href=""http://www.ifcmarkets.com/en/trading-conditions/commodities/rice?utm_source=investing&amp;utm_medium=Profile_listing&amp;utm_campaign=News"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">rice crops</a> in South-Eastern Asia.

<p>The chances for the El Nino effect in August-October 2017 are 51%, according to U.S. Climate Prediction Center. The forecast will be updated in future. Meanwhile, the spread of rice price for export contracts has widened from $350-355 per tonne to $350-360. Thailand ranks 2nd in export rice after India.

<p>On the daily chart <strong>RICE: D1 </strong>has been moving sideways for 7 months. Is has been trading near its lower boundary. The further price increase is possible in case of lower forecast of harvest in South-Eastern Asia and in case of El Nino effects.</p>

It has been noted that in 2018 Russia diversified from U.S. assets, trimming its holdings of U.S. Treasuries and shifting into gold after the U.S. imposed sanctions on some Russian entities. The nation bought 8.8 million troy ounces of the precious metal, which meant it leapfrogged China to become the fifth largest gold holder globally behind the US, Germany, France and Italy.</p>
<p>From a technical perspective, the 55-day moving average moved above the 200-day moving average on January 17 for the first time since June 26. Support may be found at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the November 13 to January 4 rally at 1,260.</p>

<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/platinum"" id=""5fc347758c808"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8910"">Platinum</a></span> </strong>is still bogged down by the issues of waning demand and oversupply. The metal is facing its third week of declines in a row and is sitting just about 5% above decade lows. However, in comments made last week in a Bloomberg interview, investment manager PIMCO said that it prefers platinum over gold, and highlights that it would require only a slight shift from gold ETFs into platinum ETFs by investors to change the dynamics. It classes platinum as unloved and relatively cheap compared to other precious metals. Platinum is currently at 795.40.</p>
<p>The reverse dynamics to platinum, rising demand, and limited supply are driving<strong> palladium's</strong> extended surge to record highs. The precious metal rose above 1,400 for the first time ever last Thursday, peaking at 1,440 before edging lower on some profit-taking. It is trading at 1,396.95 today.</p>

<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc347758c9de"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">Crude Oil</a></span></strong> has been on a gradual uptrend since late-December, rising more than 22% from the December 24 low. West Texas Intermediate touched the highest since December 5 yesterday as investors focused on the impact of promised OPEC output reductions on supply. The softer China growth story appears to have had limited impact on perceived future demand for oil. The weekly API crude inventories data as at January 18 is due tomorrow, and could face the fourth consecutive weekly drawdown of stockpiles.</p>
<p>As well as OPECs cuts, latest data showed the US oil drilling rigs count slid to its lowest since May last year, the first decline since 2016, according to Reuters. However, Chinas <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc347758ca74"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">crude oil</a></span> refinery throughput rose 6.8% from a year earlier to hit a record 603.5 million tonnes in 2018, according to Chinas National Bureau of Statistics. This came despite 2018 GDP growth slowing to 6.6% for the year, the slowest in 28 years.</p>
<p>From a technical perspective, WTI breached the 55-day moving average last Friday for the first time since October 16. It completed a third straight weekly gain last week but so far appears to be struggling to maintain the upward momentum this week.</p>

India Sugar Mills Association, the leading industry body in that country, trimmed its 2018/19 sugar output forecast by 2.5% to 30.7 million tonnes, due to increased demand for ethanol from sugarcane. Meanwhile, Britains only company to produce sugar from local beets has scaled back its production estimates for 2019 to 1.15 million tonnes, a drop from 1.37m tonnes in the previous season, despite a higher sugar content from local beets. Sugar last traded at 0.12814.</p>

The sentiment was given a boost when reports circulated last week that US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin was considering lifting tariffs ahead of the meeting, in order to enhance prospects of an agreement. Having suffered the most since the tariff war began, soybean prices are enjoying a revival on hopes of a solution.

<li>Each year is a new adventure for the ag sector</li>
<li>Corn, beans, and wheat prices fall</li>
<li>Energy and meats present unique challenges in 2020</li>
</ul><p>The United States is the global leader in the production and export of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc348dbdca3d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc348dbdcc56"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">corn</a></span> to the world. The U.S.'s agricultural sector is also a significant producer of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc348dbdcd1f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">wheat</a></span>, the primary ingredient in bread.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Agricultural commodities are the staples that feed populations around the globe. At the end of April 2020, there were approximately 7.65 billion mouths to feed in the world, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Each year, the number of people on our planet grows by around eighty million. Therefore, the demand side of the equation for food is always expanding.</p>
<p>The crop year in the northern hemisphere begins with planting in the spring. During the summer months crops grow, leading to the fall harvest. When it comes to the prices of corn, soybeans, and wheat futures, it's weather conditions across the critical growing areas in the United States and other producing nations around the world that determine the size of annual crops.</p>
<p>As we are now in the heart of the spring season, uncertainty about the weather over the coming months typically causes increased price volatility in the grain futures markets at this time of the year. But 2020 is hardly an ordinary year in markets across all asset classes because of the global pandemic, and agricultural products are no exception.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Each year is a new adventure</strong></h2><p>The agricultural products that feed the world do not have the same shelf life as other commodities like <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc348dbdcdd7"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">crude oil</a></span>, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/copper"" id=""5fc348dbdce79"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8831"">copper</a></span>, and many others. While grains and other agricultural products can sit in silos and terminals when production is higher than consumption, they deteriorate over time. Therefore, each crop year is a new adventure as the growing population requires more fresh food products each year. Bumper crops have become an addiction for a hungry world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last time grain shortages developed was in 2012 when drought conditions sent the prices of corn and soybeans to all-time highs and wheat to its highest price since 2008 when it reached a record level. Mother Nature determines the weather each year, which is the leading factor when it comes to the path of least resistance of prices.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Corn, beans, and wheat prices fall</strong></h3><p>The global deflationary spiral has sent the prices of grains to low levels as the planting season in the U.S. will lead to the all-important growing season in May and the summer months. The potential for drought conditions can cause price spikes in the grains during the growing season as futures prices become as fickle as the weather.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The monthly chart of nearby corn futures on the CBOT shows that at the $3.11 level at the end of last week, the price was near the lowest level in a decade. The last time that corn traded below $3 per bushel was in 2009. Corn traded to a record high of $8.4375 in 2012.</p>

<p>The monthly chart of CBOT soybean futures illustrates that the price of the oilseed at $8.4625 is a lot closer to the low over the past ten years than the high. The beans reached a peak of $17.9475 in 2012 during the last significant drought in the U.S.&nbsp;</p>

Bread is a staple for people around the world, and feeding people is an essential requirement for governments. Throughout history, many examples of civil uprisings were the result of wheat shortages or rising prices. The most recent example was the Arab Spring in 2010, which started as bread riots in Tunisia and Egypt after wheat shortages from the 2008 crop.&nbsp;</div><p>As we head into the 2020 crop year, prices are at low levels, and the markets are assuming that there will be another bumper crop. If Mother Nature does not cooperate, watch out. Should that happen, prices for all of the leading grains could suddenly soar.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Energy and meats present unique challenges in 2020</strong></h2><p>The energy market <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/analysis/commodity-prices-can-fall-below-zero-why-that-happens-how-to-hedge-200522714"" id=""5fc348dbdd2b2"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""pal"" data-articleid=""200522714"">collapsed in April</a></span> with crude oil trading to its lowest level in history as the nearby NYMEX futures contract fell into negative territory before expiring. In the U.S., the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/ethanol-futures"" id=""5fc348dbdcf1d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""961732"">ethanol</a></span> mandate requires a blend of the biofuel with <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gasoline-rbob"" id=""5fc348dbdcfc9"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""954867"">gasoline</a></span>. Corn is the primary ingredient in U.S. ethanol.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img title=""Gasoline Futures Monthly 2008-2020"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic5a01d7ae672a70556071c779736f6c9c.png"" alt=""Gasoline Futures Monthly 2008-2020""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Gasoline Futures Monthly 2008-2020</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p>The monthly chart shows that at the end of April, the price of gasoline was at 75 cents per gallon compared to over $2.00 at the same time in 2019. Since approximately 30% of the annual U.S. corn crop goes into ethanol production, the weakness in gasoline and oil prices was weighing on the price of the coarse grain as it heads into the season of uncertainty.&nbsp;</p><div>&nbsp;</div><div>When it comes to soybeans, processors crush the oilseed into two products, soybean meal, and oil. The meal is the primary ingredient in animal feeds. Cattle and hogs consume soybean meal that fattens the animals before they head to processing plants.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img title=""Lean Hog Futures Monthly 2008-2020"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic5cb692950ca75c5c9f0a3726206b7107.png"" alt=""Lean Hog Futures Monthly 2008-2020""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Lean Hog Futures Monthly 2008-2020</span></div></div></div></div><p>The monthly chart of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/lean-hogs"" id=""5fc348dbdd077"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8913"">lean hog futures</a></span> shows that the price of pork fell to its lowest level since 2002 in April.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Live cattle fell to the lowest price since 2009. The low prices for meats are leading ranchers to euthanize animals rather than feed them, as processing plants have slowed production because of outbreaks of coronavirus.</p>
<p>In April 2019, the prices of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/live-cattle"" id=""5fc348dbdd122"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8914"">live cattle</a></span> and lean hogs were at $1.2375 and 84.285 cents per pound, respectively. This April, cattle were at the 90 cents level with hogs below 60 cents per pound.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Low energy and meat prices create unique problems for grain prices during the current deflationary spiral. Meanwhile, over 7.6 billion people in the world depend on agricultural products for nutrition. Since the weather will determine supplies, we are now at the time of the year, where uncertainty peaks as the growing season begins.</p>
<p>Adding to that uncertainty is the potential for <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/news/stock-market-news/european-stock-futures-drop-as-us-china-spar-over-virus-origin-2159320"" id=""5fc348dbddc0f"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""oal"" data-articleid=""2159320"">renewed friction</a></span> between the U.S. and China on the trade front. While the two countries signed a phase one trade deal in mid-January, COVID-19 could change the dynamic. The U.S. and other nations blame Chinese leadership for a lack of information that could have controlled the spread of the virus and prevented the pandemic.</p>
<p>Since China has consumed one-quarter of the U.S. annual soybean crop in the past and Chinese pork supplies were ravaged by African swine fever last year, a return of tensions on the trade front could cause more volatility in agricultural commodity prices, especially soybeans and hogs.</p>
<p>With prices at or near the lowest levels in years, the downside potential for prices could be limited and the upside potentially explosive. If drought conditions limit the 2020 crop, we could look back at the end of April as a time when grains were at bargain-basement prices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Philippine International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) has released its forecast of slumping rice stocks in major exporting countries. This may happen in the second half of the current year due to the drought. Philippines are high-volume rice importer and their economy may suffer from the probable rice deficit. Will the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/rough-rice"" id=""5fc3460947f00"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""13916"">rice</a></span> become dearer?</p>
<p>The gross stockpiles of Thai, Vietnam, Pakistan and US may fall to the lowest since 2008 to 19mln tonnes, according to International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). During the recent peak of stockpiles in 2013 they reached 41mln tonnes. The rice was worth 3 times more in 2008 than now. Major world rice producers including India imposed restrictions on its export because of poor crops. Philippines usually purchase 1.5-1.7mln tonnes of rice in the global market but now the state agency National Food Authority is willing to acquire the additional 0.5mln tonnes of rice to replenish supplies. Late in March the Agriculture Ministry of Vietnam reported 160 thousand hectares, or 10% of the countrys rice seedlings suffered from droughts.</p>

The Bollinger bands? have contracted which means lower volatility. The bullish momentum may develop in case the rice surpasses the last fractal high, the Parabolic signal and the resistance of the downtrend at 10.34. This level may serve the point of entry. The initial risk-limit may be placed below the Parabolic signal, Bollinger band and the last fractal low at 9.53. Having opened the pending order we shall move the stop to the next fractal low following the Parabolic and Bollinger signals. Thus, we are changing the probable profit/loss ratio to the breakeven point. The most risk-averse traders may switch to the 4-hour chart after the trade and place there a stop-loss moving it in the direction of the trade. If the price meets the stop-loss level at 10.34 without reaching the order at 9.53, we recommend cancelling the position: the market sustains internal changes which were not taken into account.</p>

1606633543-3431,https://www.investing.com/commodities/us-wheat-opinion/4,Perfect Storm Brewing for Price Inflation,https://www.investing.com/analysis/perfect-storm-brewing-for-price-inflation-200430183,"By Stefan GleasonCommoditiesJun 10, 2019 01:26PM ET","<p>A perfect storm is brewing for midwestern farmers. Unending rains have led to the flooding of tens of millions of acres of farmland. The deluge comes on the heels of years of low crop prices.</p>
<p>It has the makings of an agriculture disaster on a scale never seen before.</p>
<p>The nation may see a perfect storm in terms of food inflation. Prices for some farm commodities figure to be a lot higher in the months ahead as markets adjust to dramatically lower crop yields. This will be coupled with price hikes associated with tariffs on all manner of goods from China and elsewhere.</p>
<p>To top it off, the Fed is signaling a reversal. The next move in interest rates now figures to be lower.</p>
<p>Grain and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc348453cc03"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybean</a></span> prices are already on the move. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc348453ce37"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">Corn</a></span> prices began climbing rapidly in early May. Today the price per bushel is 20% higher than a month ago. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc348453ceea"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">Wheat</a></span> prices are 7% above the lows of a month ago, and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc348453cf9d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span> are 11% higher.</p>
<p>Chinese tariffs on U.S. agricultural products pushed prices lower earlier in the year. However, the longer-term effect of those particular tariffs may wind up being less than many think. The market for food commodities is global and demand is somewhat inelastic.</p>
<p>More than a billion Chinese need to be fed. What they dont purchase directly from the U.S. will need to be purchased elsewhere. We can expect to see an increase in American exports to other places.</p>
<p>President Trump increased the tariffs on Chinese imports from 10% to 25%. Americans can look forward to paying higher costs for many consumer goods in the months ahead. The chart below shows recent CPI data through April.</p>
<p>Costco (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/costco-whsl-corp-new"" id=""5fc348453d041"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""6443"">COST</a></span>) told investors to watch for higher prices on the merchandise they sell in the most recent earnings call. The retail giant recently declared prices will go up on things.</p>
<p>Fed Chair Powell is using the tariffs and the prospect of price inflation as justification for changing course. He said last week the central bank will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion. He and his cohorts stand ready to combat a weakening jobs market and dwindling international trade by lowering interest rates.</p>
<p>Bond yields are deeply inverted. Historically inversions of this sort have been a dark omen. They often signal a recession and falling stock prices.</p>
<p>Given the central bankers obsession with stock prices and ongoing pressure from the Trump administration to avoid any major correction, the Fed moving preemptively to cut interest rates isnt surprising.</p>
<p>However, it isnt at all certain that lowering rates now can forestall what is coming. Individuals and corporations have already binged on debt. The growing mountain of borrowed money is weakening the nations economic prospects, not making them stronger.</p>
<p>The adjacent chart is telling:</p>
<p>Stock prices are riding upon the Fed Put. There is no great earnings strength anymore. Stock investors simply wont sell stocks because they anticipate the Fed will step in with stimulus.</p>
<p>That expectation is 100% logical given the central banks track record. But logic also dictates something else: stock prices will one day reflect earnings reality.</p>
<p>If lowering rates doesnt work to prop up stock prices, we can count on the Fed to double down by dropping rates again or by finding even more exotic and aggressive ways to stimulate.</p>
<p>This all amounts to bad news for the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/us-dollar-index"" id=""5fc348453d0fa"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8827"">U.S. dollar</a></span> and for consumers who will have to contend with higher prices.</p>
<p>But there is a silver lining for precious metals investors</p>
<p>Concerns over price inflation have been absent from the markets for nearly a decade. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc348453d19d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">Gold</a></span> and silver markets are heavily reliant upon safe-haven demand as a key driver. With powerful inflationary forces now building, that demand looks like its about to surge.</p>

The metal was given an additional lift after Trump said Friday the proposed US-China trade negotiations scheduled for next month could be canceled. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) had increased their physical holdings of gold for a 10th straight day, Bloomberg reported yesterday.Gold has extended the gains into this week, hitting the highest level versus the greenback since April 2013. Gold is rising toward the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the 2011-2015 drop at 1,587.<strong>Gold Monthly Chart</strong><strong>SILVER</strong> likewise is benefiting from the global turmoil, rising to the highest since February 2018 in early trading this morning. Speculative investors used last weeks rally to book some profits as they were net sellers of silver for the first time in four weeks, the latest <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-silver-speculative-net-positions-1621"" id=""5fc3486ed6797"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1621"">CFTC</a></span> data show. That pulled net long positions from their most bullish since November 2017.The gold/silver (Mint) ratio has been trading within the parameters of resistance at the 55-day moving average at 89.85 and support at the 200-day moving average of 86.25 since July 18.<strong>PLATINUM</strong> has been trading conservatively over the past week, with moves and volatility kept to tight ranges, which meant speculative accounts turned net sellers of the precious metal for the first time in four weeks.<strong>PALLADIUM</strong> has started this week positively, adding to last weeks gains. The commodity is slowly climbing from two-month lows and has eyes on the 55-day moving average at 1,479.5. That moving average has capped prices since the beginning of the month.<h3><strong>Base metals</strong></h3><p><strong>COPPER</strong> is struggling to maintain any upward momentum after touching seven-month lows last week. With no discernable satisfactory conclusion to the US-China trade war in sight, demand expectations for the industrial metal continue to be scaled back. Speculative investors are most bearish on the metal since records began in 1993. This bearish mood continues despite data showing that <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/copper"" id=""5fc3486ed63a8"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8831"">copper</a></span> stocks in warehouses monitored by the London Metal Exchange are the lowest in more than a month as at August 9.</p><div class=""outerEleWrapper"">

Last week saw a drawdown of 3.4 million barrels, the eighth consecutive weekly drain. On the supply front, weekly data from Baker Hughes highlighted that the number of US oil rigs in production fell for a sixth week and are now at the lowest since January.West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is currently at $54.78 after touching $55.16 yesterday, the highest in a week. The current rebound in oil prices has helped WTI recover from losses of as much as 12.7% this month as demand fears remained elevated by the US-China trade standoff. IEA has trimmed its 2019 and 2020 demand forecasts to 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd) for this year and to 1.3 million bpd for next year.<strong>WTI Daily Chart</strong><strong>NATURAL GAS</strong> remains under pressure with this months losses contributing to a nine month losing streak, the longest negative period since 2008/09. Gas prices may find some support at current levels amid forecasts of higher than normal temperatures across the entire US for the August 17-21 period. Data from the EIA showed an increase in stockpiles of 55 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week to August 2, less than the 59 bcf forecast but the 19th consecutive increase in reserves.<h3><strong>Agriculturals</strong></h3><p><strong>CORN</strong> prices slumped Monday after the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) published its latest World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report. In the report, the USDA raised the average <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc3486ed650e"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">US corn</a></span> yield while increasing overall corn production.</p>
<p>Corn acreage was trimmed to 90 million from the previous estimate of 91.7 million, while production was seen at 13.9 billion bushels, up from the July estimate of 13.8 billion. Some suggest that the data provides further evidence that, as a result of the trade war, more farmers are switching to corn production from soybeans. On the demand side, Chinas Agriculture Ministry raised its 2018/19 imports forecast by 700,000 tonnes to four million tonnes.</p>
<p>Corn fell the most since July 2013 yesterday and has extended losses in early trading this morning, to touch the lowest level since May 17. From a technical perspective, the commodity is heading toward the measured objective of a head and shoulders reversal pattern below 3.60.</p>
<p>Speculative investors trimmed their net long positions for a third straight week in the week to August 6, according to <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-corn-speculative-net-positions-1813"" id=""5fc3486ed6832"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1813"">CFTC</a></span> data.

</div><p><strong>WHEAT</strong> prices posted the biggest daily loss on record yesterday after the USDA WASDE report. The report bumped up <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc3486ed65c5"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">US wheat</a></span> production by 3% to 1.98 million bushels while boosting its forecast for 2019/20 season-end stocks by 1.5% to 27.6 million tons.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia announced last week that it was relaxing its import rules, including stipulations about the maximum percentage a batch can suffer bug damage. This would open the way for Russian suppliers to tender for shipments. While on Russia, the USDA WASDE report cut its estimate for Russian wheat output for the 2019/20 season by 1.6% to 73 million tons.</p>
<p>Wheat prices slumped to the lowest since May 24 yesterday and opened below the 100-day moving average for the first time since August 2.</p>
<p><strong>SOYBEAN</strong> prices were also dragged lower by the WASDE report, which halted a three-day rising streak. China cut its 2018/19 soy imports estimates by 1.5 million tonnes to 83.5 million tonnes due to lower shipments in July. Speculative investors were net sellers for a third consecutive week.</p>
<p><strong>SUGAR</strong> attempted a rebound from 10-month lows late last week but the two-day rally was halted yesterday. Sugar is now at 0.1146 with the 55-day moving average at 0.1201.</p>

And thats exactly what market bulls who backed the commodity through this years roller coaster ride feel as it cruises toward one of its biggest annual gains.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">At Wednesdays settlement of $2,311 a tonne, cocoas most active December contract on ICE Futures US promised a 22 percent return for anyone who had bought in at the end of 2017 and held since. With investors and tacticians projecting highs in the $2,400-$2,500 range next, the confection-and-beverage material could remain the second best performing commodity through the third quarterif it doesnt usurp the top spot held by <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc3473116eef"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">wheat</a></span>, that is.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic737d42f68bc741d839f51536be7418ed.jpeg"" alt=""Cocoa Weekly Chart"" title=""Cocoa Weekly Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Cocoa Weekly Chart</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While believing in cocoas resilience was a prerequisite for investors who weathered steep losses earlier this year, some admitted relief, even surprise, with the markets ability to come back from a 13-percent drop in May and a 14-percent plunge in July.</p>
<h2>Lucky Bet For Some</h2>
<p dir=""ltr"">We got lucky, said James Cordier of Optionsellers.com in Tampa, Florida, who correctly called a $200 rebound for cocoa just after the July selloff that brought it down to $2,153 a tonne. Cordier told Investing.com:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir=""ltr"">We think cocoa is pretty close to fairly priced right now, with a little bit more upside left...We see it at between $2,450 and $2,500 in the fourth quarter, partly because of supply scares. Its not clear how easy it will be to get cocoa out of certain parts of West Africa going forward. Were going to have to add $50 to $100 a tonne just for that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir=""ltr"">Peter Mooses of RJO Futures in Chicago concurred.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Supply/demand news has been volatile but there is very little chance that production numbers will recoup enough to pressure the market, Mooses, who trades cocoa and other soft commodities, wrote in a commentary.</p>
<h2>Supply And Weather Concerns Aid Highs</h2>
<p dir=""ltr"">If <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cameroon-separatists/anglophone-cameroons-separatist-conflict-gets-bloodier-idUSKCN1IX4RS"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">transportation blockage</a> starts to affect key growing areas ability to move their cocoa, prices may reflect this short-term, he said.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Although cocoa was technically overbought, there were enough fundamental concerns to convince market bulls to add to positions, said Mooses. Weather premium may also be added to the equation this time of season. Look for $2,400 to be the next target.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Shawn Hackett, the founder of Hackett Financial Advisors, an agricultural markets consultancy in Boca Raton, Florida, agrees that weather will be the markets driver in coming months. Whether an El Nino-driven drought can cause production hiccups will make all the difference to cocoa prices, he said in a recent note.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Cordier of Optionsellers says he places more faith on cocoa grinds, which were expected to continue improving in the second half, supporting higher prices. Grinding produces important primary products from cocoa, such as the powder used for baking goods and the butter that gives chocolates and ice cream their velvety texture.</p>
<h2>Grinds Figures Mixed</h2>
<p dir=""ltr"">Cocoa grinds in <a href=""https://www.eurococoa.com/en/all-about-grind-stats/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Europe </a>produced about 6 percent better results in the first half of 2018 versus the same period a year ago, while those in <a href=""https://cocoaasia.org/news20180720.php"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Asia</a> were about 10 percent more productive, on the back of stronger economic growth. <a href=""https://www.candyusa.com/data-insights/cocoa-grinds-report/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">North American grinds</a>, in comparison, turned out about 2 percent less products.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But cocoa grinds can also play out differently when economies slow, Cordier said. While theres little correlation between cocoa demand and anemic growth in the US, theres a definite impact in poorer countries, where chocolate is a luxury. He added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir=""ltr"">If theres a contagion of sorts in emerging markets or if trade negotiations and sanctions dont ease up in the relatively near future, it will start taking its toll on more than just currencies or the stock market.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Some Caution Too</h2>
<p dir=""ltr"">Investing.coms own daily technical outlook has a Buy recommendation on cocoa, with sell only triggered at the 100-day moving average of $2,456. I think cocoa bottomed out at the $2,100 level and I dont think itll go any lower, said Mike Seery of Seery Futures in Plainfield, Illinois.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Were heading into Halloween and the holiday season after this, where therell be high demand for chocolate. There are very few commodities now that Im bullish on, and Im bullish cocoa.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But sweet high or not, some are cautious about betting on a further upside in cocoa. Hackett, for instance, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir=""ltr"">We would expect that the next decline in prices would in fact produce that important buy signal and give us the basis for recommending purchases...Right now, we do not see that on the horizon just yet and we will wait patiently.""</p>

<p>Still, the dollar could see more profit-taking this week on speculation that the US and China <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/17/us-china-plot-roadmap-for-meeting-between-trump-xi-to-resolve-trade-dispute-dow-jones.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">may cut a trade deal</a> ahead of President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinpings summit in November. The Dollar Index, measured against a basket of currencies, on Thursday posted its largest drop since late July after reports broke that Chinas vice minister for commerce, Wang Shouwen, will lead a nine-member delegation to talks with U.S. officials on August 22-23, spearheaded on the US side by Treasury undersecretary David Malpass .</p>
<p>The dollar has become a de facto safe haven asset in recent months as the trade standoff led the two nations to slap tit-for-tat tariffs on each other.

<h2><strong>Soy, Hogs Could Add To Gains</strong></h2>
<p>Soybeans, which have borne the brunt of the US-China trade spat because of Beijings 25 percent tax on US-grown soy, experienced its sharpest weekly gain in two months last week buoyed by the news that the two nations were to resume trade talks.</p>

<p>The 4.3-percent weekly gain brought the front-month September contract for US soybeans to a settlement of $8.8625 per bushel last week, above its 50-day moving average of $8.7428. That made it a Strong Buy, according to <a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans-technical"" target=""_blank"">Investing.coms daily technicals</a>. With Level 3 Fibonacci resistance seen at only $9.0967 for September soybeans, the contract could have a further upside of 23 cents.</p>

<p>For wheatthe star of the grains complex with an annual gain of 31 percentthe potential upside became more accentuated after forecasts that Australia's September weather will be drier than in August. Last weeks 2.4-percent gain in wheat also came on the back of reports that Russia, the world's top wheat exporter, <a href=""https://www.agriculture.com/markets/newswire/grains-wheat-tops-one-week-high-on-worries-russia-may-curb-exports-0"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">will consider restricting 2018-19 shipments</a> to 30 million tonnes. Even before those restrictions, the global wheat market was already rocked by worries of reduced harvests in Russias Black Sea region, Europe and Australia.</p>
<p>At Fridays settlement of $5.6000 per bushel for the key September contract, Investing.coms daily technicals rate US wheat as a Strong Buy. Fibonacci patterns put strong support at $5.2383 per bushel and Level 3 resistance at $5.6683.</p>
<p>As for natural gas, weather forecasts are projecting a cooling trend over the middle section of the US, which might be bearish for air-conditioning and power demand, said Dominick Chirichella of the Energy Management Institute in New York. But that outlook was being offset by a bigger C and bullish C picture of thin gas stockpiles held in underground salt caverns for the winter, he said. All models (are) projecting the deficit to continue right to the start of the upcoming winter heating season, Chirichella added.</p>
<p>At Fridays settlement of $2.946 per million metric British thermal units, September natural gas was deemed a Strong Buy on Investing.coms daily technicals. Fibonacci patterns put Level 3 resistance for September gas at $2.974 per mmBtu.</p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

Those who had missed the maize party may have yet another buy-in opportunity in grains now: wheat.</p>

The rally came on the back of the U.S. Department of Agricultures move to slash Russian wheat production by 3.8 million metric tonnes to a new estimate of 74.2 MMT due to drought.</p>
<h3><strong>Chicago Wheats Fortunes Transformed By Russian Crop Anomaly</strong></h3>
<p>Jeff Kaprelian of the Hueber Report consultancy in St. Charles, Illinois, summed it up in a note on Friday:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks wheat! After todays USDA report thats what farmers should be saying.</p>
<p>Or perhaps, more appropriately, 'spasibo pshenitsa' since the USDA  helped put world wheat ending stocks at the low end of estimates and 7.88 MMT lower than last months report.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With Thursdays tick up in CBOT wheat, the market is up just 3.4% on the year, presenting a fairly low entry cost versus relative return opportunity for would-be investors, compared with Chicago <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc348644758a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">corn</a></span>, which already carries a year-to-date gain of more than 18%.</p>
<p>Investing.coms Daily Technical Outlook has a Neutral call on CBOT wheat, projecting a top upside of above $5.51. If that 30 cent per bushel premium is achieved, that would already be an additional gain of nearly 6%.</p>
<h3><strong>From Australia To Ukraine, E.U. And the U.S., Wheat Is Under Stress</strong></h3>
<p>The USDA World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report from Thursday also projects lower wheat exports for Australia and Ukraine that creates further opportunities for the crop in the E.U. and the U.S.</p>
<p>But that is notwithstanding crop conditions in the latter two, which are also facing their own adverse weather dynamics.</p>
<p>Said Jack Scoville, chief grains analyst at Chicagos Price Futures Group brokerage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are forecasts for hot and dry weather in the Midwest. Drier weather is forecast for Canada.</p>
<p>It is still hot and dry near the Black Sea so crops in these areas of Russia and Ukraine are being hurt. It is almost harvest time for Winter crops in these areas. Conditions are very hot in Europe and kernel fill could be affected.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Corn Still In Rally Mode, But Wheat Offers Lower Entry Cost</strong></h3>
<p>Corn itself is still in rally mode, said Scoville, citing crop development thats way behind.</p>
<p>He added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The root structure for much of the corn in the Midwest is not good due to the previous wet weather.</p>
<p>USDA showed that crop condition was as expected, but that the crops remain very late. It will take a very late fall to get the crops home with no additional losses as there is a long way to go. It is warmer now so the crops have a chance to progress, but rain will be needed frequently due to the poor root structure as the crop got planted in mostly very wet conditions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kaprelian, however, urges investors not to read too much into these numbers issued by the USDA for corn, as there were also gains to be made in other stressed crops such as wheat.</p>
<p>He added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The market recognizes the USDA is re-surveying acreage now and the yield is a complete guess. At the same time, we shouldnt be too hopeful for a dramatic reduction in acreage. The USDA has defended their 91.7 million acre number and they wont likely make fools of themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Investing.coms Daily Technical Outlook for corn still suggests a Strong Buy. The top upside of above $4.68 forecast for CBOTs benchmark corn for September would mean a 5.4% premium from current levels C slightly lower than wheats.</p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

The market is poised for its biggest monthly gain since 2012. And theres a good chance you can still profit if you had missed the rally so far.</p>
<p>Thats all the good news.</p>
<p>Now, for the not-so-good news: Corn prices could see extreme swings in the coming days, weeks and months from weather changes.</p>
<p>So, if youre planning to get your feet wet in this market, beware.</p>
<h3><strong>Volatility Is 'Sky High', Warns Seery Futures</strong></h3>
<p>Thats the caution from Mike Seery, a specialist in commodity futures technicals at Plainfield, Illinois, who wrote in a report on Wednesday that volatility in corn</p>
<blockquote>
<p>is sky-high at the present time, all due to the fact of terrible weather conditions in the Midwestern part of the United States.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The founder of Plainfield-based Seery Futures said Wednesdays 25-cent swing in <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc34832bf165"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">corn futures</a></span>where the front-month July contract on the Chicago Board of Trade went from a peak of $4.38 per bushel to a low of $4.13was unusually wide by the markets standards.</p>
<p>Said Seery:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am in the state of Illinois which rains every single day and we have heavy rain in the forecast over the next several days as there is no planting taking place in the area that I reside.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Only 58% Of Crop Planted, Against The 90% Average</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I do not believe we will plant 100% of the corn crop in 2019. The volatility in corn will certainly remain extremely high over the next several months as we are at a critical juncture for corn planting, as I still believe there will be more acres shifted into soybeans. Soybean planting is only at 29%, behind schedule as well, as we have a real problem across the board.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crop progress reports issued on Tuesday by the U.S. Department of Agriculture shows corn farmers having only planted only 58% of the crop, experiencing the slowest pace on record that is well behind the 90% average. Crop emergence, meanwhile, is at only at 32% of the normal pace of 69%.</p>
<p>The resultant squeeze on this seasons corn harvest could be a constraint to industries that depend on the grain, including the packers of livestock feed and those that manufacture starch, sweeteners, corn oil and beverage, as well as the distillers of industrial alcohol and fuel ethanol.</p>
<p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic41972d01e91828f8c050b0b306853ac1.jpeg"" alt=""Corn 300-Min Chart - Powered by TradingView"" title=""Corn 300-Min Chart - Powered by TradingView""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Corn 300-Min Chart - Powered by TradingView</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p>Anticipation of supply tightness in all these has led to milestones not seen in quite a while in the corn market. Wednesdays $4.38 per bushel high was a peak since July 2016. The front-month contract is poised to finish May 18% higher, the largest monthly gain since July 2012. Corn is also the best-performer among CBOT grains this year, with an annual gain of 11%, versus a 3% loss in both <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34832bf3bb"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc34832bf47c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">wheat</a></span>. Even more phenomenal is the fact that the corn rally itself is less than five weeks old.</p>
<h3><strong>Investing.Coms Daily Outlook Has 'Strong Buy' On Corn; Projects Another 10% Gain</strong></h3>
<p>Investing.coms daily technical outlook rates July corn a Strong Buy and projects a top level resistance of $4.58 for the contractwhich, based on Wednesdays settlement of $4.18, leaves room for another 10% gain.</p>
<p>Indeed, higher prices are likely for corn, said Jack Scoville, vice-president at The Price Futures Group in Chicago and author of the brokerages daily report on grains.</p>
<p>Said Scoville:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The chart shows that the trends are changed and that higher prices are possible, with moves to about $4.75 on the nearest futures a possibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While corn futures could continue to outperform now, prices could fluctuate later from the global situation, he said, adding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""There is a good crop coming in Brazil and Argentina, so the U.S. will have competition for sales.""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dan Hueber, who writes The Hueber Report on agriculture out of St. Charles, Illinois, said planted corn seeds were sitting in soppy soils in most parts of the Midwest, and any idea of a trend line or better yield would seem improbable.</p>
<p>Said Hueber:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do understand, my intention here is not to build up the hype anymore that it has already, particularly seeing that corn prices are pressing up against the upper range of trade for the past five years, but it is challenging to think we will witness anything more than quick corrective and possibly volatile breaks until we have reached out to get a look at the pollination period in July.""</p>
<p>Weather markets are always a challenge because we are contending with the unpredictability of Mother Nature, and this one has shaped up to be one for the record books. I guess I can be thankful that I lost most of my hair years ago and this summer would appear certain to take the rest of it.</p>

The industrial metal had been on the three-day downward track at the end of last week as data showed Chinas copper imports fell 0.6% y/y in the January-February period. Note, data at the start of the year is always impacted by the timing of the Lunar New Year holidays and the first two months data are usually aggregated.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Futures Exchange noted that copper stockpiles tracked by it rose to the highest in eight months, suggesting copper may struggle to make significant gains unless demand picks up. However, speculative investors remain bullish as they boosted the net long positions to the highest since the week of June 26, the latest CFTC data as of March 5 showed.</p>
<h2><strong>Energy</strong></h2>

Inventories have fallen for the past 15 weeks yet prices have been unable to rally. Natural gas is now at 2.773.</p>
<h2><strong>Agriculturals</strong></h2>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc347c73573a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">Wheat</a></span></strong> equaled the lowest in more than a year this morning as the commodity is pressured by the latest crop forecasts. The U.S. Department of Agricultures World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report published Friday sees higher supplies, lower exports, slack domestic demand and larger stockpiles for wheat. Meanwhile in separate report, the United Nations forecast that global output of wheat could climb 4% this year. Theres nothing bullish in those two reports.</p>
<p>Speculative investors are already bearish on the commodity, with short bets at the highest since January 2018 after being net sellers for a fourth straight week, CFTC data showed. Wheat is now at 4.211.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc347c7357e6"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">Soybean</a></span></strong> prices shrugged off news that China was buying U.S. soybeans on Monday. Year-to-date soybean imports are down 14.9% y/y at 11.83 million tones, with February imports at 4.456 million tons, according to customs data. Speculative accounts are at their most bearish since November last year. Prices touched 8.756 yesterday, the lowest since December 28. Soybeans are now trading at 8.768.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-sugar-no11"" id=""5fc347c735895"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8869"">Sugar</a></span></strong> is attempting a rebound from just over two-month lows, posting modest gains for the past two days, as questions were raised about Brazils expected bumper crop, with wetter-than-usual weather conditions affecting the countrys center-south cane-growing areas. There are hopes that Indias plans to increase the ethanol blending in petrol to 20% from 10% could help reduce current oversupply conditions in the country.</p>
<p>Speculative investors turned net sellers for the first time in four weeks, according to data to March 5 supplied by CFTC. Sugar closed at 0.12345 (what a nice number!) yesterday with the 55-day moving average at 0.1249.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc347c735949"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">Corn</a></span></strong> is struggling at five-month lows after the WASDE report pegged <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc347c7359eb"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">U.S. corn</a></span> stockpiles at 1.835 billion bushels, which was higher than analysts had forecast in a Bloomberg survey, and the USDA predicted smaller U.S. exports this year.

Both nations imposed matching tariffs last month on $34 billion apiece of each others products and have plans to add another $16 billion worth of goods to their lists, which cover <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/03/business/china-us-trade-tariffs.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">products from <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""></span></a><a href=""/commodities/steel-rebar"" id=""5fc346e5958ef"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""996702"">steel</a> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/aluminum"" id=""5fc346e595997"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""49768"">aluminum</a></span> to washing machines and even dried fruit.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">China has also warned of levies on US crude, which it has become the second largest buyer of. Even without such a threat, oils critical importance to the global economy makes it vulnerable in any trade war, especially one involving the worlds top two economic superpowers and energy consumers.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Trade War Casting A Cloud</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It is casting a cloud over most asset markets, including oil, Dominick Chirichella, analyst EMI DTN in New York, said of the trade row, although he added that minus the rhetoric I do not believe this will be a long-term issue, and over the next several months, I am expecting to see progress toward a negotiated settlement.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">US West Texas Intermediate crude has had net losses for six straight weeks, with Thursdays near 2% rebound preventing a bigger decline last week. From 3-1/2 year highs above $75 per barrel at the start of July, WTI settled on Friday at $68.49 per barrel C down 7% on the month and almost 10% off from this years peak. UK <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/brent-oil"" id=""5fc346e595a30"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8833"">Brent</a></span>, the global benchmark for crude, has lost similarly, settling at $73.21 from highs of $80.50 hit in May.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Investing.coms daily technicals call for a Neutral on WTI, with Fibonacci support levels earmarked at $68.51, $68.46 and $68.40. Resistance was pegged at $68.63, then at $68.68 and later at $68.74. The pivot was seen at $68.57.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Lower Inventory And Rig Count Could Redeem WTI</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The wild card for WTI will be weekly U.S. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/crude-oil-inventories-75"" id=""5fc346e595b99"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""75"">crude storage data</a></span>. Stockpile figures for the week to July 29 showed a surprise build up of 3.8 million barrels versus a forecast drawdown of 2.8 million barrels. Even so, a large inventory drop this week could put WTI on a fresh course to reattempt $70.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Mixed signals from large inventory and export swings driven by a volatile Brent-WTI arbitrage has exacerbated price moves between $67 and $70 per barrel, TD Securities noted in its weekly outlook on oil.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The rig count for the week to Aug 3, reported by oil services firm Baker Hughes, showed a 2-unit drop C barely material to production but significant, nevertheless, to the psyche of oil bulls concerned about demand for WTI amid the China tariff threats and growing global inventories.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Output from top oil exporter Saudi Arabia has recently increased to around 11 million bpd, and U.S. production has also come around to those levels. Russia, meanwhile, pumped an additional 150,000 barrels per day in July from a month earlier, to reach 11.21 million bpd.</p>

<h3><strong>Promise Of Trade Deal Jolts Grains Around</strong></h3>
<p>The promise of a trade deal between the worlds two biggest economies, which remains a promise after multiple meetings held by U.S. and Chinese negotiators, have yanked <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc347b75c55c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc347b75c613"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">corn</a></span> prices around, preventing them from rallying despite evidence of strong purported demand.</p>

<p>Futures of soybeans are up less than 3% on the year on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Corn contracts are barely 0.1% higher.</p>
<p>Wheat has so far posted the largest move of the three, down 7% on the year, a phenomenon caused by bumper harvests from strong European and Australian yields.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding that, traders report that China is in the market for all three of those grains and moreif the trade deal with the U.S. can materialize.</p>
<h3><strong>China Needs Lots Of Grains...But Needs Trade Deal First</strong></h3>
<p>Jack Scoville, vice president at The Price Futures Group in Chicago and author of the brokerages daily grains report, wrote in his latest summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>China is apparently willing to buy a lot of U.S. agricultural goods, with some wire services stating that it could buy between $45 and $50 billion each year.""</p>
<p>""Wire services said that China had offered to buy another 10 million tons of U.S. soybeans as a goodwill gesture. It was reportedly looking for soybeans yesterday, but would need to buy corn and wheat as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scoville also makes clear that prospective Chinese buyers have no problem locking in these commoditiesif not for the complication posed by the 25% duty Beijing has maintained on $50 billion worth of U.S. agricultural imports since last summer in its tit-for-tat tariffs war with Washington. Soybeans, corn and wheat fall under those duties.</p>
<p>The U.S., for its part, has a 10% levy on $200 billion of Chinese imports and was on the verge of raising those taxes to 25% at the start of this year when the two sides decided on a three-month ceasefire on Dec. 1 in order to negotiate a trade deal.</p>
<h3><strong>Trade Talks ProgressingNot Enough To Prompt Significant Rally</strong></h3>
<p>With less than a week to that deadline, U.S. President Donald Trump pledged to hold off on further hostilities, as negotiations seemed to be going well. Though not well enough to reach a deal, apparently. On Monday, the U.S. president reported that trade officials on both sides were ""very, very close"" to a resolution that ""could happen fairly soon, or it might not happen at all"". Trade sources, however, said Chinese negotiators were having issues meeting some key demands from the U.S.</p>
<p>Scoville outlined the problem in his note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The intellectual property rights and forced technology transfers as well as Chinese structural reforms remain key sticking points and will need much more time to be negotiated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At Tuesdays closing, soybeans front-month May futures settled a touch higher, at $9.1762 per bushel. For the year, the contract is up 2.6%.</p>
<h3><strong>Mixed Calls On Soy, Corn And Wheat</strong></h3>
<p>Technical analysts on Investing.com have a <a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans-technical"">Strong Buy</a> call on May soybeans, projecting a top-end, or Level 3 Fibonacci resistance, at $9.3516.</p>
<p>But specialist intelligence service Farm Futures was more conservative on soybeans in its in a mid-February <a href=""https://www.farmprogress.com/story-weekly-soybean-review-0-30767"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">outlook</a>.</p>
<p>Senior market analyst Bryce Knorr said in that note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>U.S. commitments to China are down by as much as 550 million bushels. Thats just too large a hole to overcome, at least this year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Corn's benchmark May futures settled up 0.1% at $3.7588 per bushel in Tuesdays session. For the year, the contract is up 0.2%. Technical analysts are <a href=""/commodities/us-corn-technical"">Neutral</a>, projecting a Level 3 Fibonacci resistance at $3.8430.</p>
<p>In another sector <a href=""https://www.seeitmarket.com/u-s-corn-futures-outlook-bullish-view-longer-term-19027/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">outlook</a> published on Monday by investing research website See It Market, Marcus Ludtke, vice-president of Sitos Grains and Commodity Marketing Company, commented:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Corn continues to trade in a tight range in early 2019. But theres a lot going on with the fundamental picture.</p>
<p>Count me in the camp of those still not seeing the economic justification for a 2.9 million planted acreage increase in corn for 2019.</p>

<p>Knorr wrote in a separate Farm Futures <a href=""https://www.farmprogress.com/story-weekly-wheat-review-0-30768"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">outlook</a> from Feb. 13 that wheat had a bright, shining moment last summer, when threats to crops across Europe and into the Black Sea and Australia raised hopes that the time was right for the U.S. to begin selling lots of the grain to a hungry world.</p>
<p>But yields overseasoutside of northern Europe and Australiaturned out better than expected, and those sales by and large were slow to materialize, Knorr wrote, adding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Business finally picked up as the calendar flipped to 2019, but it may be too little, too late for a wheat market on the verge of life support.</p>

</div><p>The US Department of Agriculture reported a 60-million-bushel revision upward of 2019/20 all-wheat production estimate in its monthly Wheat Outlook released August 14. Based on that expansion of projected wheat production USDA lowered season-average farm price (SAFP) forecast for 2019/20 20 cents per bushel on lower wheat price expectations for the remainder of the market year. At the same time it upgraded <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc34878b4afa"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">US wheat</a></span> export prospects citing lower wheat prices as opportunity to expand U.S. sales in the new marketing year. However last week wheat export inspections came at 18.1 million bushels, lower than the prior weeks 20.8 million bushels. Weak demand and higher supply estimates are bearish for wheat.</p>

<p>We believe the bearish momentum will continue after the price breaches below the lower boundary of Donchian channel at 468. This level can be used as an entry point for placing a pending order to sell. The stop loss can be placed above the upper Donchian boundary at 478.5. After placing the order, the stop loss is to be moved every day to the next fractal high, following Parabolic signals. Thus, we are changing the expected profit/loss ratio to the breakeven point. If the price meets the stop loss level (478.5) without reaching the order (468), we recommend cancelling the order: the market has undergone internal changes which were not taken into account.</p>

<p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picb991cb8087b7a2341a263343bbee9aee.jpeg"" alt=""NatGas Weekly Chart"" title=""NatGas Weekly Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">NatGas Weekly Chart</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p>With just one session left for the year-end after Friday, the market is showing an annual gain of just under 20 percent.</p>
<h3><strong>Mixed Weather Chipping Away At Gains</strong></h3>
<p>Natural gas was up nearly 60 percent six weeks ago, powered by an early blast of pre-winter chill, before mixed weather began chipping away at its returns.</p>
<p>While the earlier gains put gas at the top spot for commodities performance this year, current returns only give it third spot after <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-cocoa"" id=""5fc347695cb6b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8894"">cocoa</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc347695cc26"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">wheat</a></span>, which are up 25 percent and 20 percent, respectively (desktop users, click <a href=""/commodities/real-time-futures"">here</a> and go to performance to see all commodity returns for 2018).</p>
<p>Dan Myers, analyst at Gelber &amp; Associates, a Houston-based consultancy for natural gas, said the trade was actively scouring weather models for another bout of sustainable cold, which appeared elusive.</p>
<h3><strong>Traders Beginning To Lose Faith In Quick Return To Cold</strong></h3>
<p>Myers added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recent trading has been of the technical variety as the market continues to monitor weather forecasts for any change that could drive another big move. However, with the latest forecasts wiping out strong cold in early January, the market is beginning to lose faith.</p>
<p>The burden is now on colder-than-normal winter weather to materialize more convincingly if it is to prevent prices from slumping further.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Until those frigid conditions arrive, traders will be paying more attention than ever to weekly <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/natural-gas-storage-386"" id=""5fc347695ce54"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""386"">supply-demand data</a></span> of gas. The latest of that, for the week ended December 21, is due at 11:00 AM ET (16:00 GMT) on Friday. The US Energy Information Administration, which will be issuing the figures, is expected to report a drawdown of 52 billion cubic feet for last week, or just about a third of the 141 bcf cited for the week ended Dec. 14.</p>
<p>Even with that 141-bcf draw, the second triple-digit weekly consumption of gas since the start of the cold season in September, the market was volatile, rallying sharply at first and then falling just as dramatically on concerns that demand for heating will be tepid in coming weeks due to mixed weather.</p>
<h3><strong>Record Output Matched By Demand Earlier In The Year</strong></h3>
<p>It has been a tricky year for the fuel. Huge volumes of gas, sourced from primary drilling and also obtained in secondary form during drilling for shale crude, has led to record output in 2018not unlike the situation in <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc347695ccd7"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">crude oil</a></span>.</p>
<p>Despite such overwhelming production, storage levels of gas never got out of hand, thanks first to strong summer heat, followed by an early bout of cold, that kept air-conditioners and heaters on overdrive since June. In fact, gas reserves before the start of winter were under the 5-year norm.</p>
<p>That aside, a surge in the export capacity of liquefied natural gas has also boosted the demand equation for US natural gas this year. From just around 3 bcf per day a year ago, LNG export capacity is almost at 5 bcfd now. The EIA expects it to reach nearly 9 bcfd by the end of next year, making the United States the country with the third largest LNG exporting capacity after Qatar and Australia.</p>
<h3><strong>Whipsaw Volatility Hasnt Helped</strong></h3>
<p>While prices north of $3 per million metric British thermal units had been the norm lately, a colder-than-usual November pushed the market to nearly $5 per mmBtu at one point.</p>
<p>But there has also been whipsaw volatility in recent weeks, with daily swings of up to 18 percent C three times more than last years peak.</p>
<p>Independent gas analyst James Hyerczyk said in an analysis Wednesday that there was still a lot of uncertainty over next weeks weather forecasts.</p>
<p>Hyerczyk wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Traders could start pricing in cold snaps that are forecast for January 1-3 and January 6-9. However, there are still milder patches predicted for December 31-January 1 and January 4-5. These forecasts dont seem to be impressive enough to sustain a long-term rally.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Highs North $3 Seen Staying Though </strong><strong>Capitulation</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Still Possible</strong></h3>
<p>Even so, some forecasters were pricing in significant cold for February that could cross over into March, Hyerczy kadded.</p>
<p>The analyst concluded that the mixed technicals and the fundamentals would keep gas prices in their sideways trend. At Thursdays settlement, the most-active gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange, March, settled at $3.353 per mmBtu.</p>
<p>He said March gas could attempt to take out its next resistance of $3.659 if the upward resistance held. But if the market capitulated for any reason, then it could break under $3.109, triggering a slide that could go all the down way to a November 2 bottom of $2.890.</p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

Subsequent reports that bilateral talks would resume on Wednesday eased some worries that Ottawa might be excluded completely from the US-Mexico trade deal announced last week.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, a US-China trade dealwhich will change dynamics across asset classesremained elusive at the weekend. What's been lingering was a report that US President Donald Trump planned to move ahead with tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods, risking retaliation from Beijing.</p>
<p>On the economic calendar, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/nonfarm-payrolls-227"" id=""5fc3472955e78"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""227"">US jobs numbers</a></span> for August will be the main data set for investors look out for, with a forecast jobs growth of 191,000 versus Julys 157,000.</p>
<h3><strong>Gain Or Loss For Crude With Summers End?</strong></h3>
<p>Angst from tariff battles aside, energy bulls had a good month as well as a stellar final week in August.</p>
<p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic3defda2f6758146e4474f44ce79942c4.png"" alt=""Brent 300 Minute Chart"" title=""Brent 300 Minute Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Brent 300 Minute Chart</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p>Crude prices, led by UK <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/brent-oil"" id=""5fc347295363c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8833"">Brent</a></span>, ended August up nearly 2 percent on bets that a renewed global shortage could occur from US sanctions imposed on Iran exports which begin in early November. US <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc34729536ec"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">crude</a></span> returned above the key $70 per barrel mark, though it slipped at the start of September trade. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gasoline-rbob"" id=""5fc3472953792"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""954867"">Gasoline</a></span> rallied to the $2 per gallon level.</p>
<p>It was as recently as June that many predicted oil prices would be lower in late 2018 and into 2019, said Matthew Tuttle of Tuttle Tactical Management, a Stamford, Connecticut-asset manager overseeing $550 million in exchange-traded funds with exposure to energy securities, among others.</p>
<p>While crudes bearish outlook was largely transformed by the fallout from Trumps cancelling of the Obama-era US-Iran nuclear deal, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/analysis/what-to-expect-in-oil-next-week-next-month-and-beyond-200341416"" id=""5fc3472954786"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""pal"" data-articleid=""200341416"">other global ramifications</a></span> were also pushing oil higher, Tuttle said. <a href=""http://www.arabnews.com/node/1362626"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Venezuelas meltdown</a> could cause a big increase in crude prices, to even $100 per barrel, depending on weather conditions this winter.

<p>Additionally in energy, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/natural-gas"" id=""5fc347295384e"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8862"">natural gas</a></span> stayed within striking distance of the $3 per million metric British thermal units (mmBtu) as money managers <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/analysis/more-hefty-stock-injections-needed-to-quell-natgas-bulls-200341630"" id=""5fc34729553bd"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""pal"" data-articleid=""200341630"">boosted their positive bets on the fuel</a></span> ahead of last weeks <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/natural-gas-storage-386"" id=""5fc3472955f24"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""386"">largest stockpile growth</a></span> in two months.</p>
<p>Energy bears, meanwhile, have counterarguments on why US crude will continue sliding this week and gasoline could move substantially below $2 per gallon. They point to the end of the peak summer driving period in the US, marked by Mondays Labor Day holiday, and how that will affect refining demand for crude as well as direct consumption of gasoline.</p>
<p>Natural gas could also retreat further from the $3 per mmBtu target if the late summer heat forecast by weather services fails to show up, causing a slack in air-conditioning demand.</p>
<p>Investing.com's technicals called for a ""Strong Buy"" in US crude, with Level 3 Fibonacci resistance only seen at $71.05. With gasoline, however, it was a ""Strong Sell,"" with the strongest resistance projected at $2.0242 per gallon. For natural gas, the outlook was ""Neutral.""</p>
<h3><strong>Beware Palladiums Lure</strong></h3>
<p>While <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc34729538f2"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">gold</a></span> closed down <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/analysis/chart-of-the-day-200341442"" id=""5fc3472955d81"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""pal"" data-articleid=""200341442"">for a fifth straight month</a></span> in Augusta losing streak only matched previously in 2013palladium continued to provide alpha, or outperformance, to discerning precious metals investors.</p>

<p>Used mainly for purifying gasoline engine emissions, palladium has turned around after two straight months of losses, to settle on Friday at 10-week highs of $980.30, providing a gain of 5 percent to market bulls. While Investing.coms technicals called for a Strong Buy in palladium, the Fibonacci Level 3 resistance it projected was only at $987.97 C suggesting limited upside ahead.</p>
<p>ADM Investor Services also believes the risk of holding palladium is growing, especially without a US-China trade deal which might result in hefty auto tariffs for Beijing. It would be foolish to think that palladium prices will hold up in the event that optimistic trade hopes are dashed, ADMIS said in a pre-weekend note. The $950 level has become some form of bull/bear/resistance line in the sand.</p>
<h3><strong>Cocoa: Runaway Gains May Continue</strong></h3>
<p>Among soft commodities, cocoa would be the market to watch after a blistering 14 percent gain in Augustthe largest move across the commodities spectrum.</p>
<p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic8792cb892275c1fed7d8e10ec980ad13.png"" alt=""Cocoa 300 Minute Chart"" title=""Cocoa 300 Minute Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Cocoa 300 Minute Chart</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p>The commodity, used for confectionery and beverage products, continues to hold a Strong Buy recommendation on Investing.coms daily technical outlook, with a Level 3 Fibonacci resistance of $2,284 per tonne versus Fridays settlement of $2,333signaling a potential upside of nearly $50. Although cocoa appeared technically overbought, there could be enough long-term fundamental concerns in the crop to add to positions, said Peter Mooses of RJO Futures.</p>
<p>While supply/demand news out of main growing region West Africa has been volatile, there is little chance that production will recoup crop losses from earlier in the season to pressure prices, he said. If transportation blockage starts to affect key growing areas' ability to move their cocoa, prices may reflect this short-term issue, Mooses said. A weather premium may also be added to the equation this time of season. Look for $2,400 to be the next target level.</p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

Yet, as the Christmas jingle goes, December could still be The Most Wonderful Time of the Year for the confection-and-beverage ingredient, with strong demand likely to spare it the fate thats befallen many markets in the space.</p>
<p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic8324f8221b38d1007cbacdad3919da97.jpeg"" alt=""Cocoa Weekly Chart"" title=""Cocoa Weekly Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Cocoa Weekly Chart</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p>At Thursdays settlement of $2,170 per tonne in New York, cocoa returned 15 percent to investors who had bought at the end of 2017 and held since.</p>
<p>But as recent as November 7, that return would have been 27 percent as the commodity traded at near two-year highs of $2,397 a tonne.</p>
<h3><strong>Funds Sell</strong><strong>ing Trims Down Cocoa Returns</strong></h3>
<p>Since then, selling by fund managersplausibly cashing out their cocoa winnings to cover losses in other soft commodities like <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-sugar-no11"" id=""5fc346f82f1cb"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8869"">sugar</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/arabica-coffee-4-5"" id=""5fc346f82f27f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""964526"">arabica coffee</a></span>, which are down 15 percent and 11 percent respectivelyhas diminished returns.</p>

<p>For cocoa, it still a good year, considering that it ended 2017 down 11 percent, after extending a 33-percent slump from 2016. Analysts attribute this years turnaround to a better global economy compared to the past two years.</p>
<h3><strong>Year-End Festivities Hold Promise</strong></h3>
<p>And multiple festivities from Hanukkah to Christmas and New Year in December mean high consumption and gifting of candy and treats that bode well not only for cocoa investors and confectioners, but also for the grinders who produce the cocoa butter needed for making chocolates and ice-cream, and the cocoa powder required for baking.</p>
<p>Jack Scoville, senior softs analyst at Chicagos Price Futures Group, said that, based on latest supply-demand statistics, merchants were still actively buying cocoa beans amid higher-than-usual production from Ivory Coast and other major West African producers. Said Scoville:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If youre a chocolate-maker, youd have covered all of your demand for cocoa by now, as your products must be on the shelves before December. If youre still buying actively, even if its for next years requirement, it indicates that demand is pretty good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Market intelligence gathered by Price Futures Group shows that cocoa prices were being supported by willing buyers for beans at West African ports, but funds were offsetting the positive impact by short selling the commodity. Scoville added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thats part of the explanation for the markets current performance. Just about every commodity right now is at support area from investor liquidation and cocoa, unfortunately, is one of them. Still, the unusual demand were seeing ahead of Christmas might still makes this The Most Wonderful Time of the Year for cocoa.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Large Production And Willing Buyers Make For </strong><strong>A Perfect Two-Sided Trade</strong></h3>
<p>Shawn Hackett of Hackett Financial Advisors, an agricultural markets consultancy in Boca Raton, Florida, concurs with the strong demand outlook for cocoa projected by Scoville. Hackett noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For now, we see no imminent weather threat for cocoa, which means the current large crop harvest coming out of West Africa will continue to weigh this market down while aggressive demand from Asia keeps this market well supported.""</p>
<p>""A great sign of this strong demand is despite record arrivals of cocoa beans from West Africa, cash price differentials have been surging, suggesting prices are too low.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With such a perfect two-sided trade, any disruption in West African production could lead to a violent upward adjustment, he said, adding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For now, we remain on the sidelines, but are looking to buy this market near $2000 support when a new smart-money buy signal is triggered.</p>

<p>Thailand has sold to Indonesia 500 thousand tonnes of new rice crop for 8bn bahts. The talks around this intergovernmental deal pushed the grain prices up, but when the deal was cut, the prices went down. Will the rice continue growing?</p>
<p>Judging by the details of the deal between Thailand and Indonesia, the approximate contract price for rice was $445, which is 4.3% above the price of $426.6 a tonne for 300 thousand tonnes of the Thai rice sold to Philippines in September. Meanwhile, the current rice quotes on the CME are below those of September. Thailand is negotiating selling 1mln tonnes of rice to China with delivery early next year. In Philippines, the rice crop has fallen 3% hit by typhoon Lando. Now the officials are going to import extra 1.3mln tonnes of rice next year. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (UN FAO), this year the global rice production will be 0.6% less than in 2014, totaling 491.4mln tonnes. In fact, the contraction may prove to be much more severe in case of El Nino effect.</p>

<p>On the daily chart, the <b>Rice: D1</b> has switched from the downtrend to the neutral and is above its 200-day moving average line. Parabolic indicator and MACD have formed buy signals. RSI is neutral and below 50, no divergence. The Bollinger bands? have widened, which may mean high volatility. The bullish momentum may develop in case the rice surpasses the last fractal high and closes the price gap at 12.74. This level may serve the point of entry. The initial risk limit may be placed below the last fractal low at 11.51. Having opened the pending order, we shall move the stop to the next fractal low following the Bollinger and Parabolic signal. Thus, we are changing the probable profit/loss ratio to the breakeven point. The most risk-averse traders may switch to the 4-hour chart after the trade and place there a stop-loss moving it in the direction of the trade. If the price meets the stop-loss level of 1.133 without reaching the order of 1.101, we recommend cancelling the position: the market sustains internal changes which were not taken into account.</p>

Data also showed that the number of online U.S. rigs fell to the lowest since early-May last year.</p>

This average is at 0.1241 today and has supported prices for almost two months.</p>

Speculative investors appear to be throwing in the towel on bullish bets, as net longs were pared back to the lowest since September 25, according to the latest CFTC data. Although prices tested below the 100- and 200-week moving averages at 3.5997 and 3.6066, respectively last week, the commodity managed to close above them, so they remain intact. Corn closed at 3.648 yesterday.</p>

<p>Good Morning!</p>
<p>White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow was quoted that reports that a preliminary trade meeting between the U.S. and Chinese officials was canceled,  with respects the story is not true, Kudlow said to CNBC. Also U.S. exporters last week loaded six Soybean vessels bound for China, the most in any week since the start of the tariff war between Washing and Beijing which is an encouraging sign to U.S. farmers hard hit by the trade fight. Also Dan Basse president of Chicago-based Ag-Resources was quoted,  This shows that the Chinese are active in shipping and keeping their promise that they not only bought U.S Beans but they are keeping their promise that they not only bought U.S. Beans but theyre taking U.S. Beans. We see that as encouraging. Other encouraging news is that China pledged to buy more <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc3477c5558e"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">Corn</a></span>, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc3477c55781"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">Crude Oil</a></span>, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/ethanol-futures"" id=""5fc3477c55841"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""961732"">Ethanol</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc3477c55905"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">Ethanol</a></span>. This positive news is a far cry from what the IMF was preaching yesterday, in which their data is historically wrong. On the Corn front the March contract is currently trading at 380 ? which is 1 ? of a cent higher. The trading range has been 381 to 379 ?.</p>
<p>On the Ethanol front the February contract is currently trading at 1.272, which is .001 higher. The trading range has been 1.273 to 1.271. % contracts traded and Open Interest is at 1,253 contracts. The market is currently showing 2 bids @ 1.272 and 2 offers @ 1.276. U.S. and China trade talks could be a boon to producers profits.</p>
<p>On the Crude Oil front the market is slowly recovering after the IMF crying chicken little sounding like Ocasio-Cortez that the world is going to end by climate change if she doesnt get her 70% tax on the rich. Lets take a look at how many excessive taxes brought down healthy economies, and the fundamentals on Crude Oil is showing rig counts biggest drop in 3 years, Frackers continue to curb output and unfortunately in some cases cease operations and OPEC will continue production cuts. This with China needing to come to the table and negotiate seriously this market is do to explode. In the overnight electronic session the March Crude Oil is currently trading at 5325 which is 24 cents higher. The trading range has been 5364 to 5269.</p>

The question is , how long will the cold weather stay? It depends on who you ask. In the overnight electronic session the February Natural Gas is currently trading at 3.125 which is 8 ? cents higher.

On the vol side, we can see how the implied has been diverging from the short-term historical realized vol (HV20) since late Nov. The divergence is more than implied simply falling, but it's in fact the coincidence of implied dropping as the HV20 has risen. In English, the implied vol has been dropping as the stock's actual movement has been rising. As of right now that vol diff is quite large. Specifically:<br><br>IV30?: 55.15<br>HV20: 92.12<br>HV180: 72.58<br><br>I'll get back to that little yellow line I drew in the vol chart, later. For now, let's turn to the Skew Tab, below.<br><br><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/1324540757_0.gif"" border=""0"" alt=""tex_skew_12-21-11"" title=""tex_skew_12-21-11""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">tex_skew_12-21-11</span></div></div></div><br><br>We can see how Jan vol is depressed relative to Feb and Apr. A part of Jan's lower vol is the inclusion of the Holiday season. But it's not Jan that interests me.&nbsp; The last four years, TEX earnings have been announced on:<br><br>2-9-2011<br>2-17-2010<br>2-11-2009<br>2-20-2008<br><br>Feb expiry this year is 2-18-2011. Tricky... Even more tricky, check out the earnings dates for the cycle before the Feb release:<br><br>10-20-2010<br>10-21-2009<br>10-22-2008<br>10-24-2007<br><br>And this year, earnings were released 10-26-2011. Earnings tend to be on Wednesdays for TEX. It seems like the next earnings cycle could be released on either Wednesday 2-15-2012 or Wednesday 2-22-2012. I believe it's that ambiguity that has Feb and Apr options priced to nearly identical vol.<br><br>Let's turn to the Options Tab for completeness.<br><br><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/1324540810_0.gif"" border=""0"" alt=""tex_options"" title=""tex_options""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">tex_options</span></div></div></div><br><br>We can see Jan is priced to 55.15 vol, while Feb is priced to 63.91 and Apr to 63.50. Back to the Charts Tab -- that ~63iv level is the yellow mark on the chart. Looking back to the vol comps, we can see that even that level is depressed to the HV20 and HV180.

<li>The demand side of the equation favors wheat and other agricultural products</li>
<li>Each year is a new production adventure</li>
<li>Levels to watch in 2021</li>
</ul><p>If you ask people what the most political commodity is, the popular answer would likely be crude oil. Indeed, the energy commodity <em>is</em> highly political.</p>
<p>More than half the worlds crude oil reserves are in the Middle East, a highly turbulent region. For decades, instability in the area contributed to price volatility in the oil futures market. In 1990, when Saddam Hussein marched into Kuwait, the nearby oil price doubled in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Since the 1970s, US energy policy has focused on independence from Middle Eastern oil. In recent years, technological advances in extracting crude oil from shale regions and a favorable regulatory environment have succeeded in making the US the worlds leading producer. The future of US production will be in the hands of President-elect Joseph Biden and the members of Congress and the US Senate. A greener approach to US energy policy could hand the political advantage back to OPEC, the international petroleum cartel, and Russia.</p>
<p>Still, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc3491ba12a3"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">wheat</a></span> has a far longer history as a political commodity. As the primary ingredient in bread and other staple food products, populations worldwide depend on annual wheat supplies for nutrition.</p>
<p>Wheat is a matter of national security. For leaders to maintain power, the availability of food is a key requirement. The French Revolution began as protests over bread and food shortages. Rising food prices and supply deficits have fomented uprisings and led to leadership changes throughout history.</p>
<p>The most recent example came during the Arab Spring in 2010 as bread riots in Tunisia and Egypt changed the political leadership across many Middle Eastern countries. When anyone asks me which commodity is most political, my answer is <em>always</em> wheat.</p><h2><strong>Prices rise to an almost six-year high</strong></h2><p>Since falling to a low of $3.5950 in August 2016, the wheat futures that trade on the CBOT have made higher lows and higher highs. The CBOT soft red winter wheat contract is the most liquid wheat futures contract and the benchmark for global wheat prices. </p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img title=""Wheat Monthly"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic807b1cc097e6dcd7ab9e972f20ee5ae3.png"" alt=""Wheat Monthly""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Wheat Monthly</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p><em>Source, all charts: CQG</em></p>
<p>The monthly chart, above, shows that wheat futures made another higher high in October, at $6.3820, and was just below the $6 per bushel level at the end of last week. Last month, wheat futures rose to the highest price since December 2014.</p>
<p>The next technical target on the upside stands at $6.77 per bushel. The open interest metric was at the 438,228-contract level at the end of last week, which was above the midpoint of the year in the aftermath of the 2020 harvest in the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>Price momentum and relative strength indicators were over neutral readings and rising but have yet to enter an overbought condition. Meanwhile, monthly historical volatility at 19.21% was at the lowest level in 2020 and since early 2014. The price action on the upside has been slow and steady. </p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img title=""Wheat Daily"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic14a80ed27dd8d912738defff19d7973b.png"" alt=""Wheat Daily""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Wheat Daily</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p>The daily chart shows that a significant rally in wheat futures began in late June at $4.7950 and lifted the price of December futures to $6.3825 per bushel last month. On Nov. 10, wheat put in another bullish reversal on the daily chart on the highest volume since mid-February.</p><h2><strong>The demand side of the equation favors wheat and other agricultural products</strong></h2><p>The demand side of wheats fundamental equation is a function of the addressable market, which is continually growing. Each quarter, the world adds twenty million more people. Each year, there are approximately eighty million more mouths to feed. In 2020, there were more wheat consumers than in 2019, and in 2021 there will be more than in 2020.</p>
<p>At the turn of this century, around six billion people inhabited our planet. </p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img title="""" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/6270e6526f16e51486c3436721449bc1.png"" alt=""""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText""></span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p><em>Source: </em><a href=""https://www.census.gov/popclock/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><em>https://www.census.gov/popclock/</em></a></p>
<p>As of Nov. 13, there were almost 7.7 billion wheat consumers globally, more than a 28.3% gain over the past two decades.</p>
<p>The addressable market continues to expand for wheat and all agricultural commodities.</p><h2><strong>Each year is a new production adventure</strong></h2><p>While the fundamental equations demand side is continually growing, the supply side is a year-to-year affair. The most significant factor for supplies is the weather across the worlds growing regions during each crop season. Wheat prices rose over the past months on dry conditions in some areas of the world. Meanwhile, the latest <a href=""https://www.usda.gov/oce/commodity/wasde/wasde1120.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">November WASDE report</a> on Nov. 10 told the wheat market that projected global stocks fell by one million tons but remains at a record high level.</p>
<p>While there is enough wheat to meet global requirements over the coming months, the weather across the globe will determine if that remains the case in 2021. Mother Nature will make the final determination.</p>
<p>The bearish trend in the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/us-dollar-index"" id=""5fc3491ba14d3"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8827"">US dollar</a></span> against other world currencies adds a bullish tone to the wheat and all commodity markets since the USD is the pricing benchmark for raw material markets. The tidal wave of central bank liquidity and government stimulus during the global pandemic increases the money supply. It erodes the purchasing power of fiat currencies, which is another bullish factor for wheat.</p><h2><strong>Levels to watch in 2021</strong></h2><p>If the price action from 2008 through 2012 is a guide for commodity prices, we could see them move substantially higher over the coming months and years. While the global financial crisis in 2008 was far different than the pandemic, central banks and governments have employed the same tools to deal with the current economic environment as they did a dozen years ago.</p>
<p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img title=""Wheat Quarterly"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picd5b50396473a452e74eeb96ae3a540a1.png"" alt=""Wheat Quarterly""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Wheat Quarterly</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p>As the quarterly chart illustrates, CBOT wheat futures rose from $4.2525 in 2009 to successive highs of $8.9325 in 2011 and $9.4725 per bushel in 2012.</p>
<p>The path of least resistance for wheat futures depends on the weather, next years crop, and the financial condition of the world because of COVID-19. The next levels to watch on the upside are the 2014 peaks at $6.77 and $7.35 per bushel. The 2012 high at $9.4725 would be the next upside target for CBOT wheat futures.</p>
<p>The all-time high in wheat occurred in 2008 at $13.34.50 per bushel, which played a role in the Arab Spring as high prices caused by low supplies triggered sweeping political change in North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>Wheat remains a highly political commodity. The world depends on the grain that's an essential ingredient for worldwide nutritional requirements.</p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

<h3><strong>Energy</strong></h3>
<p><strong>CRUDE OIL</strong> prices have been rising steadily this year as planned production cuts by OPEC members and their allies restrict supply. Saudi Arabia limited production to 10.2 million barrels in January versus a target of 10.3 million, and announced plans to restrict production by a further 400,000 barrels in March.</p>
<p>Adding to the short squeeze, an unscheduled outage at Saudi Arabias largest offshore oilfield raised concerns about oil supply, while the U.S. sanctions on Venezuela cut off those exports. Oil prices have risen for the past five days, helped along by a softer U.S. dollar, and appear to be heading towards the 100-day moving average at $56.87. This average has capped prices since October 22. WTI is now at $55.75.</p>

The next storage data release from EIA on Thursday is expected to show a further drawdown of 157 billion cubic meters. Gas supply in the U.K. is also facing supply disruptions this week due to some unplanned outages.</p>
<p>Prices breached the 2018 lows last week, touching the lowest since December 22, 2017 last Friday. They are now at 2.652.</p>
<h3><strong>Precious metals</strong></h3>
<p><strong>GOLD</strong> has benefited from a weaker U.S. dollar during the past week, rising to a near-10 month high of 1,328 yesterday. Despite the latest uptick, speculative investors have been reducing longs for three straight weeks up to January 22, with net long positioning now at its lowest since the week of December 11, according to the latest delayed snapshot from CFTC.</p>
<p>Disasters at <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc3479f9b25f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">gold</a></span> mines have featured heavily in the news recently, with a roof collapse at a mine in Liberia on February 10 and flooding in a mine in Zimbabwe on February 16, which resulted in the loss of 24 lives. The mines were relatively small contributors to global supply, so it is unlikely that these issues were responsible for golds recent rally.</p>
<p>Fun Fact: The durability gold was captured by a Bloomberg story last week which highlighted that at the Perth Mint in Australia, the same 14-pound gold bar has been melted down and recast more than 65,000 times since the mint opened its doors to visitors in 1993, while maintaining the same size and weight.</p>
<p><strong>SILVER</strong> is also being supported by the U.S. dollars decline, with the precious metal rallying from three-week lows struck last week. The gold/<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/silver"" id=""5fc3479f9b316"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8836"">silver</a></span> (Mint) ratio has been retreating from Fibonacci resistance at 84.347 since late last week.

<p><strong>PALLADIUM</strong> has touched a new record high this morning, given an additional boost from the weaker U.S. dollar. The usual theme of high demand and short supply are still playing out in this market, with prices touching an intra-day high of 1,466 this morning. Additional upward pressure may also be coming from reductions in ETF holdings of the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/palladium"" id=""5fc3479f9b3c6"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8883"">precious metal</a></span>. Bloomberg has reported that they were just 712,000 troy ounces as at February 15, the lowest in almost a decade.</p>
<p><strong>PLATINUM</strong> still remains the poor cousin to palladium, with prices languishing near the middle of a two-month range, as its demand for catalytic converters in diesel vehicles fails to equal those of petrol-driven ones. Speculative investors also appear to be unimpressed with the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/platinum"" id=""5fc3479f9b468"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8910"">metal</a></span>, with net long positions at their lowest since last September, according to the most recent data snapshot as at January 22 from CFTC.</p>
<h3><strong>Base metals</strong></h3>
<p><strong>COPPER</strong> prices have rallied this week amid hopes for significant progress in the U.S.-China trade talks which would help global growth and hence rekindle demand for the industrial metal. In addition, strong new loans data from China suggests economic stimulus measures may be filtering through into the broader economy, which would again be supportive of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/copper"" id=""5fc3479f9b508"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8831"">copper</a></span>. Talks last week in Beijing supposedly went very well, so much so that they will continue this week in Washington.</p>
<p>Speculative investors were net buyers for the first time in nine weeks, according to the January 22 snapshot from CFTC, suggesting there is more confidence in a bullish market returning.</p>
<p>Indias Supreme Court rejected a corporate application to restart a smelting facility in the country. This could have negative implications for copper supply going forward.</p>
<h3><strong>Agriculture</strong></h3>
<p><strong>WHEAT</strong> fell the most in eight weeks last week as news on the supply front was positive. Rains across Indias wheat producing regions this week are expected to be good for the March/April harvests, which pressured prices. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc3479f9b5a7"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">Wheat</a></span> did manage to hold above the 55-week moving average at 4.954, as it has done for more than a year.</p>
<p>Speculative positioning seems unfazed by the recent decline, with investors remaining net buyers for a third straight week, CFTC data as of January 22 shows. Net-long positions are at their highest since the week of November 13.</p>
<p><strong>SUGAR</strong> prices spiked higher last Friday amid supply-related news headlines. Brazil announced that some growers may delay the next harvest following a prolonged dry spell that has affected crops. In addition, India announced a 6.9% increase in the local minimum selling price, which stoked fears that millers may sell their produce locally rather than in global markets, thus crimping supply. Furthermore, Germanys Suedzucker announced that it plans to shut two plants in France on top of the two recent closures in Germany, amid a tough pricing environment.</p>
<p>All this points to a possible disruption to supply, which should help to support prices going forward. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-sugar-no11"" id=""5fc3479f9b64c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8869"">Sugar</a></span> closed at 0.13106 on Friday and markets were closed yesterday for the U.S. holiday. They are expected to open higher today. The next potential resistance point could be the October high of 0.1333.</p>
<p><strong>SOYBEANS</strong> have posted a series of higher monthly lows since the near-term base in September last year, as progress is reported in the U.S.-China trade talks. Its now at 9.049 with resistance appearing to be around the 9.216-9.206 area, which capped advances in December and February, respectively. Speculative positioning remains net short and at its highest since the week of November 27.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reported at the weekend that a number of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc3479f9b6f5"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybean</a></span> growers in Canada are switching to more lucrative crops, given that soybean prices first and hardest hit by the U.S.-China trade spat. Soybean acreage is set to decline for a second consecutive year this year, to 6.12 million acres, according to Statistics Canada and Agriculture and Agri-food Canada.</p>

<p><strong>CORN</strong> prices look set for the first up-day in three days today as the trade talks restart later this week. Prices appear to be struggling to overcome the 3.75 mark, with four consecutive daily attempts earlier this month beaten back, resulting in a close below the level. The 55-day moving average at 3.699 could possibly lend support in the near term. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc3479f9b79d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">Corn</a></span> is now at 3.727.</p>

The complacent bulls haven't been given a reason to second-guess their bets; if the bears want to make progress, they will want to see something happen sooner rather than later. The longer prices hover in this area the more likely the edge will shift back to the bulls.</p>
<p>The meaningful economic reports and the bulk of corporate earnings are behind us. From here, the market will have to find a way to stand on its own two feet. In our opinion, the legs of the bull are a little shaky. Assuming we don't receive any surprise tweets or trade tariff resolutions, the ES should creep into the 2780ish area and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/rates-bonds/us-30-yr-t-bond"" id=""5fc3471782e37"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8907"">Treasuries</a></span> should begin to make their way higher.</p>

<p><b>Take a look at the big picture in Treasuries (monthly chart above).</b></p>
<p>As we outlined last week in the DeCarley Perspective, Treasuries are relatively cheap in regard to global value (yield vs. risk) as well as intermediate-term pricing (high yield). If you missed the report, you can access the archive here:</p>
<p><a href=""https://madmimi.com/s/395bac"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">https://madmimi.com/s/395bac<br></a><br>The weekly ZB (30-year bond) chart is telling. Although this chart suggests prices could go lower, it seems to put a higher probability on some sort of rebound. Technical oscillators are relatively low (near 20 in the William's %R and 40 in the RSI) and have flat-lined. This suggests the upside potential could be large if sentiment turns; furthermore, downward momentum has dried up. It also depicts an environment in which volatility is very low; Treasury volatility (unlike stocks) tends to favor the upside.</p>
<p>We prefer playing the upside in this complex; if you disagree and opt to play the downside please do so with limited risk. If the shorts are given a reason to cover positions, the rally could be stunning.</p>
<p><b>Treasury futures market consensus:</b></p>
<p>Seasonals are bullish and there are too many short traders in the market. The volatility risk is to the upside. We are looking for a return to the early-July highs in bonds and notes (for starters).</p>
<p>**Technical Support:** ZB : 142'04, 139'15, and 138'28 ZN: 119'01, 117'31, and 117'21</p>
<p>**Technical Resistance:** ZB: 143'20, 144'22, 145'28 and 146'12 ZN: 120'21, and 121'03</p>

<p><b>The ES has avoided disaster two sessions in a row, but three times could be the charm for the bears.</b></p>

However, one has to wonder if the bulls will continue to step up to the plate. We have a feeling that any weakness in tomorrow's session could be met with more selling.</p>
<p>According to the chart, the September S&amp;P should be headed toward the high-2700s. Yet, as we all know the market moves at any trade tariff whim, so always trade with a hedge.</p>
<p><b>Stock Index Futures Market Ideas</b></p>
<p><b>**E-mini S&amp;P Futures Market Consensus:**<br></b><br>The ES correction is underway but it is underwhelming. We continue to think 2775ish is in the cards, but it is important to be prepared for unexpected announcements.</p>

But the actual inflation numbers are much less than people think inflation is in their everyday lives. <br><br>For example, Let`s look at Cocoa prices, literally at the bottom of their five year range at 2,227 per ton, well below the 3,800 per ton level established in March of 2011.<br><br><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/1360558958_0.png"" border=""0"" alt=""COCOA 5 YEARS"" title=""COCOA 5 YEARS""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">COCOA 5 YEARS</span></div></div></div><br><b>Rough Rice Prices and Inflation</b><br><br>If we take Rough Rice which closed at $16.34 per cwt. it is well below the highs of $22.65 and $19.02 per cwt. established in April 2008 and September 2011 respectively. Sure there is a general trend higher in Rough Rice if we go back to 2003, but how actively traded was the instrument back then from an overall investment standpoint? However, the bigger picture of the last five years shows no real signs of inflation for a major food staple in the world`s diet. <br><br><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/1360558999_0.png"" border=""0"" alt=""ROUGH RICE 5 YEARS"" title=""ROUGH RICE 5 YEARS""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">ROUGH RICE 5 YEARS</span></div></div></div><br><b>Wheat Prices and Inflation</b><br><br>If we look at Wheat prices which closed at 756 cents per bushel or $7.56 per bushel these prices are also well below the highs of $13.00 per bushel and $9.65 per bushel established in February 2008 and April 2011 respectively. Again Wheat prices are much higher than 2003, but markets were so much smaller back then from a global and fund perspective. <br><br><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/1360559028_0.png"" border=""0"" alt=""WHEAT 5 YEARS CHART"" title=""WHEAT 5 YEARS CHART""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">WHEAT 5 YEARS CHART</span></div></div></div>There are just a lot of investment dynamics that modern markets with ETFs opening up additional investment options, and electronic markets allowing for greater participation levels, plus the natural progression of inflation of assets over time that play a large role in these elevated prices during a 10-year time span. <br><br>However, it should be noted that despite the price spikes, and inflation fears in the media and the investment community, Wheat prices for the most part have been pretty stable the last five years. Not exactly runaway inflation for a mass consumed food staple! <br><br><b>Emerging Markets and Inflation</b><br><br>There is no doubt that there is food inflation in emerging markets with some of the cause due to central banks exporting some inflation pressures, but most of the food inflation these countries experience is due to inefficient food supply chain issues, and poor governmental policies regarding currencies and financial market structural issues.<br><br>Of course population factors in many of the emerging economies add their own set of price pressures as well. But these issues are nothing new and not a direct result of central bank monetary policies in the developed world for the most part. <br><br><b>Higher Spending Levels and Inflation</b><br><br>In conclusion, for there to be runaway inflation in the developed economies that everyone fears right now it is going to take much more spending pressures by consumers along the entire supply chain of goods and services needed for everyday living. Not just a couple of areas like Healthcare or Education which exhibit definite higher inflation trends, and are actually mainly the result of government, corporate and insurance related subsidy issues. <br><br><b>Fed Injected Liquidity Chases Stocks &amp; Bonds Not New Clothes</b><br><br>There just isn`t the demand needed to push up spending levels to the point necessary for more capital chasing fewer and fewer goods and services. It is still skewed in the opposite direction, despite all the increase in monetary capital, but this capital isn`t chasing essential goods and services in the economy. <br><br>The loose monetary capital is meant to fill the void and help offset the lack of actual consumer spending in the economy, and the nasty effects of the deflationary, deleveraging process. The one area where we experience inflation due to the central banks is in more capital chasing fewer investment opportunities, and thus prices rise in stocks and bonds as a result during this loose monetary policy period. <br><br>But consumers are not so well off, or flush with cash, that they are massively consuming at the levels needed to cause major inflation pressures in the goods and services area of the economy. <br><br><b>The Wealth Effect &amp; Spending</b><br><br>The wealth effect will even be less than policy makers would like because not everyone is invested in 401k`s in the stock market, and investors don`t feel comfortable enough with their retirement levels to start cashing out major amounts, and putting this new found wealth back into the economy. Shoot investors are just now back to the level they were five and ten years ago. <br><br>In addition, the problem is not all assets can be reflated as many companies have gone out of business with the tech and financial market collapses, that investment capital is forever lost, and completely deflationary in nature. You can`t get back to even if you were completely wiped out in an invested company, or you were wiped out so bad, that you pulled your money from the market. <br><br>Other examples are small businesses that went bankrupt and lost all their built up equity in the business, or homeowners who lost their homes and all the money they invested over the years of home ownership. If you bought at the top of the housing market you are also caught in the deflationary trap. <br><br>That is what makes re-pricing in assets such a nasty process, and very deflationary in nature. There is so much personal wealth that is forever lost, and nothing central banks do from a monetary perspective can ever bring this wealth back into circulation chasing goods and services in the economy. <br><br><b>Banks have recapitalized their balance sheets; Consumers still have a long way to go!</b><br><br>Banks and financial institutions have enjoyed the fruits of the asset recapitalization in markets far greater than actual retail investors participating in financial markets over the last 10 years. Maybe if the Dow goes to 25,000 new investors will all be rich and pull this money and put it to use buying goods and services in the economy. <br><br>But there just aren`t enough actual consumers of overall goods and services who are doing so well in their personal finances given that wages have been stagnant for seven years to increase the spending part of the curve so that there is more capital chasing fewer goods. <br><br><b>The Underemployed &amp; Unemployed Not Flush with Cash to Spend=Deflationary Pressures</b><br><br>As I said earlier, it is still a buyer`s market, i.e., please buy the goods and services that we bring to the market. With the high number of the total unemployed or underemployed still putting substantial deflationary pressures on the demand for goods and services in the economy because they lack the financial resources we have a while to go before runaway inflation rears its unmanageable head in the developed economies of the world.        <div class=""clear""></div>"

Ahead of the meeting, Russias Putin said he was comfortable with current production levels, but would support any OPEC decision.Speculative investors increased net long positions for a second consecutive week in the week to February 25, according to the latest CFTC data, and they are now at the highest in four weeks.West Texas Intermediate (WTI) posted the biggest weekly decline since at least 2003 last week but has climbed to a five-day high this morning, and is approaching the 50% retracement level of the February 20 to March 10 drop at $48.95.</p>

The lack of upward momentum is taking its toll on speculative long positions, which were trimmed to the least since the week of July 23, according to last weeks data snapshot from CFTC. Yesterday, Bloomberg reported that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) had increased gold holdings to 2,553 tons, a near seven-year high.</p>
<p>There were reports of 15 deaths at a Siberian gold mine after a dam collapsed, though this is not expected to impact supply a great deal.Gold remains trapped in a downward-sloping channel which has been in place since Sept. 4. The channel boundaries are at 1,440 and 1,506 today with the 55- and 100-day moving averages at 1,506 and 1,457 respectively providing narrower parameters.</p>
<p>While <strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/silver"" id=""5fc3489e78e38"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8836"">SILVER</a></span></strong> has seen wild swings over the past four weeks, the Friday closing prices have kept within a very tight 17.5498-17.5593 range, suggesting neither bulls nor bears are gaining the upper hand. Bullish bets on silver were cut to the least in nine weeks in the week to Oct. 15, according to data from CFTC. The gold/silver (Mint) ratio hit the lowest since September 26 yesterday after three days of losses.</p>

That breakout occurred on Oct. 10 but failed to sustain the move, even for one day.</p>
<p>Speculative investors remain bullish on the commodity, increasing net long positions for a second consecutive week, according to the latest data from CFTC. Bloomberg reported yesterday that ETFs had increased platinum holdings for a sixth day, adding 2,555 troy ounces.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/palladium"" id=""5fc3489e78f89"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8883"">PALLADIUM</a></span></strong> is taking a breather after its latest run up to record highs last Thursday. Bloomberg has suggested that the shortage of palladium is evident in the cost of lease rates for the metal. One week lease rates have hit the highest since January, it reported citing data from Johnson Matthey, implying a lack of supply in the market. The report also saw the 2019 supply/demand shortfall at 809,000 ounces.</p>
<p>ANZ Bank said in a report last week that the supply deficit could run for the foreseeable future. The bank noted that the rally over the past four years has seen shorter and shallower retracements each time.</p>
<p>Speculative investors turned net sellers of palladium for the first time in six weeks in the week to Oct. 15, but actual long positions remain at the highest since the week of Feb. 26, CFTC data show.</p>

A positive start to this week, which saw copper reach the highest level since Sept. 16, appears to be running out of steam today and the metal is facing the first losses in four days. The improving growth outlook prompted speculative investors to turn net buyers of the metal for the first time in four weeks in the week to Oct. 15, according to CFTC data.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The sub-categories in Chinas September industrial production data saw copper output rising 11.6% from a year earlier to 838,000 tons. A strike in most ports in Chile gave copper a temporary boost. Chile is the worlds biggest copper producer, supplying 5.8 million tons in 2018, which was equal to about 28% of global output. Copper stocks at warehouses monitored by the London Metal Exchange (LME) fell Friday for the first time in four days.</p>

The commodity fell the most since January yesterday. Constant oversupply has prevented prices from rallying too far, with the latest weekly stockpiles data showing 104 billion cubic feet (bcf), up from 98 bcf the previous week and above the 5-year average of 81 bcf.</p>
<p>Chinas natural gas output increased 10.6% y/y in September, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, but the nation still imported 71.2 million tons in the month, a 10% increase from a year earlier.

But in outlining his case for wheat in 2019, Texas A&amp;M agricultural economist Mark Welch also explained why US farmers might not go wrong in planting all they could of this years second-best performing commodity.</p>
<p>While the typical story in commodities is the more the production, the weaker the price, in wheats case, output isnt matching planting efforts due to weak crop yields. And, Welch said, incredibly, the story was the same almost anywhere in the world wheat was grown.</p>
<h3><strong>Wheat Demand Outpacing Supply Across The World</strong></h3>
<p>In his address to the Texas Wheat Producers Symposium, reported by the Waco Herald-Tribune on Saturday, Welch said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When it comes to the fundamental factors driving prices on wheat, we have a very strong demand base, in that the consumption of wheat continues to grow around the world. And, we had a smaller crop in 2018, so production relative to the consumption patterns got tighter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Welch said that meant that the United States, which accounted for only 8 percent of global wheat supply despite being ranked the fourth largest for the grain with 55 million metric tons of annual output, had to increase its acreage along with its competitors in the coming year. For 2018, the US Department of Agriculture has forecast global production at 733 million metric tonnes, the lowest in five years, or down 3 percent from the 2017/18 record high.</p>
<p>According to Welch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Weve seen global wheat prices higher in the last several years. So, the signals and incentives are there that they need to plant more wheat too. Their yield prospects and their export potential, as it unfolds over the year, will be very important.</p>

<h3><strong>Second Best Performing Commodity After NatGas</strong></h3>
<p><strong></strong>At Mondays settlement of around $5.25 per bushel, wheat futures for March delivery in Chicago was up more than 22 percent on the year, making it the best performing commodity after <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/natural-gas"" id=""5fc347465a408"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8862"">natural gas</a></span>, which showed a gain of 53 percent (desktop users, click <a href=""/commodities/real-time-futures"">here</a> and go to performance to see all commodity returns).</p>
<p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic915d9d20b381fceff9eb94636a13bf52.png"" alt=""Wheat Weekly"" title=""Wheat Weekly""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Wheat Weekly</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p>Technical analysts polled by Investing.com rated wheat a Strong Buy from a daily perspective, with no indicators it was overbought despite its relatively high gain on the year. Strongest Level 3 resistance for wheat from a classic chart outlook was at nearly $5.36 per bushelmeaning the March contract had an upside of another 11 cents per bushel or so.</p>
<p>The strong outlook did not mean wheat was immune from the daily price swings affecting other commodities, said Mike Seery of Seery Futures, who pointed to Mondays broad slide in <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc347465a4c1"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">oil</a></span>, metals and grains prices caused by trade war concerns as one example. Said Seery:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wheat prices are trading above their 20-day moving average but still below the 100-day MA, which stands at $5.42 per bushel.""</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Bullish Trends Looking Likely In 2019</strong></h3>
<p>Added Seery:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The next major level of resistance is around 5.40 / 5.45 as we are now entering the very volatile winter season for wheat prices as Australia's crop has been reduced due to a significant drought as today's price action was basically blamed on profit taking. I do think as we enter 2019 the bullish trends will arrive once again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shawn Hackett of Hackett Financial Advisors, an agricultural markets consultancy in Boca Raton, Florida, concurred:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""We remain fundamentally bullish the wheat market and believe that reduced Russian exports starting in December against a very cold Northern Hemisphere winter should offer a series of winter kill events and produce bouts of upside price volatility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hackett added that recent smart money buying into a flat wheat market was a bullish sign that had triggered what he described as a Short-term Smart Money Oscillator buy signal, although there was more buying required to trigger a Long-term Smart Money buy signal.</p>
<h3><strong>In Doubt Over Wheat? Look At Corn</strong></h3>
<p>Welch said one clear indicator for wheat was <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc347465a56a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">corn</a></span> as prices for the two agricultural commodities tended to move in the same direction despite differing fundamentals. He said corn prices typically had their seasonal highs in April through June, and as the harvest in corn approached, wheat growers could get an idea of what their own price prospects could be.</p>
<p>If we were to see a situation of strongly higher or lower corn prices, I think that would have a strong influence on wheat, particularly at harvest in 2019, said Welch.</p>
<h3><strong>Just Go Out And Plant</strong></h3>
<p>Such an outlook would not just work for the Southern Plains, where wheat just fits, but in the rest of the country as well, noted Welch. To enumerate wheats problem, production in Texas, the second smallest state for the grain, dwindled to around 68 million bushels last year versus 90 million in 2015. In top growing state Kansas, it fell to 334 million from 467 million, he said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, you get your yield above average and get a decent price, thats not a bad picture for wheat. I think thats a pretty good outlook for us. Its the best outlook weve had in several years when it comes to the wheat market.</p>

Safe haven buying amid growth concerns and central bank buying for reserves diversification helped sentiment. Buying reversed yesterday after Trump announced a suspension of Mexico tariffs.</p>
<p>The ongoing U.S.-China tariff war is raising concerns about the path of future global growth while data out of China showed that it increased its gold reserves for a sixth consecutive month in May. The reserves now stand at 1,916 tonnes, according to a Financial Times report.</p>
<p>Speculative investors remain convinced that further gains are possible as they boosted net long positions to the highest since April last year, according to the latest data snapshot as at June 4 from CFTC.</p>

The gold/silver (Mint) ratio touched a record high of 90.56 yesterday.</p>
<p>More recently, speculative investors had been encouraged by silvers rebound from this years lows and turned net buyers in the latest reporting week to June 4. That was the first time in five weeks they shifted to net buyers, but overall they are still positioned net short.</p>

The bounce is seen more corrective in nature, since the global car market is still in the doldrums, reducing demand for the metal in catalytic converters. The recent weakness has seen speculative investors trimming net long positions for five consecutive weeks, and they are now at the lowest since the week of Feb. 19.</p>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/palladium"" id=""5fc348477517c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8883"">Palladium</a></span> closed above the 55-day moving average for the first time since March 26 yesterday as the metal extended its recent rebound to a third day.

<h3><strong>Base metals</strong></h3>
<p>Rising hopes that the U.S. and China will edge toward a trade deal before the G-20 summit at the end of this month have helped <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/copper"" id=""5fc348477522d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8831"">copper</a></span> rebound from five-month lows this week.

That would be the longest rising streak in a month as investors balance weather forecasts which show some above- and some below-normal temperatures across the US for the period June 15 to 19. Weekly <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/natural-gas"" id=""5fc34847755b6"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8862"">natural gas</a></span> inventories data from the EIA showed another weekly add to stockpiles last week.

<p>Chinas Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) imports in May rose 2.3% from a year earlier to 10.43 billion cubic meters, which brought the January to May total to 54.37 billion cubic meters, a 13.4% jump from the same period the previous year.</p>

Upward momentum was lost last week for the first time in four weeks, and the commodity again failed to close above the 55-week moving average, which is at 8.73 now, as it has done since May last year.</p>
<p>May customs data from China show that soybean imports were down 24% year-on-year at 7.36 million tons, the lowest total in four years for the month of May, as the swine fever that has gripped the nation for the past few months has cut the demand for soy in animal feed.</p>

The U-turn could have been instigated by a USDA report from the FAS, which suggested Brazil was close to realizing record production in the 2019/20 season. The same report estimated that Thai production would be lower during this season due to a pest infestation in some of the crops.</p>
<p>Speculative investors have been well-positioned for the recent rally, adding to net long positions for a fifth straight week. Net longs are now at the highest since the week of June 19 last year.</p>
<p><strong>SUGAR</strong> has been grappling with technical resistance at the 100-day moving average at 0.1240 since the latter part of last week.

That might be a struggle, judging from how things look early on.</p>
<p>All of that optimism about the China talks seems to be ebbing a little, and theres no timetable for a next round. Meanwhile, In corporate news, shares of Macys (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/macys"" id=""5fc347722fb6b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8945"">M</a></span>) got crushed ahead of the opening bell after the retailer reported weak holiday results and cut its outlook. On the other hand, Target (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/target"" id=""5fc347722fde6"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8180"">TGT</a></span>) reported solid holiday sales. As we say often, the retail sector is really one of individual stories, so its probably best to look at it company by company. However, as of this morning, the entire sector appeared to come under pressure.</p>
<p>Wednesdays moderately higher close for the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/us-spx-500"" id=""5fc347722fe9c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""166"">S&amp;P 500</a></span> index (SPX) marked the fourth-straight day of gains, the first time thats happened since a five-session stretch ending last Sept. 14. Though stocks closed off their highs, they still managed to finish the day just above what might be a key level at 2584. From a technical standpoint, the SPXs ability to close above that mark could signal underlying strength, some analysts believe.</p>
<h3><strong>Take Pause Before Calling A Pause</strong></h3>
<p>Stocks rose Wednesday afternoon after <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/fomc-meeting-minutes-108"" id=""5fc3477230b2a"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""108"">minutes</a></span> from Decembers Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting showed Fed officials indicating they might have more patience before raising rates further. The Fed news this week is far from over, as Fed Chair Jerome <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/fed-chair-powell-speaks-1738"" id=""5fc3477230bc3"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1738"">Powell</a></span> speaks today. Hes been out there a lot lately, and frequently moves the market in a big way one direction or another when he talks. His remarks today are scheduled for 12:45 p.m. ET.</p>
<p>And thats not all. Fed Vice Chair Richard <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/fomc-member-clarida-speaks-1803"" id=""5fc34772310f0"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1803"">Clarida</a></span> delivers a speech called Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy tonight. Those certainly sound like topics investors might want to hear about from the Fed. Clarida, who only recently took the job, has been sounding mainly dovish so far.</p>
<p>Some media reports suggested the minutes were a sign of the Fed being ready to pause on <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/fed-interest-rate-decision-168"" id=""5fc34772311bc"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""168"">hikes</a></span>, but thats arguably the wrong word to use. As we noted here yesterday, the Fed is likely going to remain vigilant about inflation. Last weeks <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/nonfarm-payrolls-227"" id=""5fc3477231264"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""227"">jobs report</a></span> looked like a bases-clearing home run, and another one like it, perhaps accompanied by rising energy prices, might have the Fed dusting off its previous more hawkish assumptions for 2019.</p>
<p>Anyone whos lived through a few market cycles likely knows the wheel can spin quickly. The Feds biggest fear probably remains inflation, mainly because when inflation rises, it tends to do so exponentially. The Fed typically wants to get out ahead of rising prices. So dont be surprised if were back here in a month or two wondering whether a rate hike might be ahead. Especially if <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc347722ff50"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">oil</a></span> goes above $60 a barrel and we have another good jobs report on our hands. As a reminder, crude rose for the eighth-straight session Wednesday and is back above $52 a barrel. Thats a more than 20% rise from the lows seen around Christmas.</p>
<h3><strong>Weaker Dollar? Possible Implications</strong></h3>
<p>Another thing the Fed minutes seemed to do, besides maybe helping give the stock market a lift, was to put more support behind the weak dollar story. The dollar index fell to near 95 late on Wednesday, the lowest level in three months. Typically, rate hikes tend to prop up the currency of the country making them, so it would stand to reason that the dollar would weaken if people expect the Fed to stay dovish.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a weaker dollar tends to also help lift commodity prices, and not just for energy. Think about food, for instance. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc3477230003"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">Corn</a></span>, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc34772300b3"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">wheat</a></span>, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/live-cattle"" id=""5fc3477230152"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8914"">cattle</a></span> and other prices all could start getting support if the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/us-dollar-index"" id=""5fc34772301f3"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8827"">dollar</a></span> stays weak, and that also could play into the inflation picture if it lasts a while. Speaking of which, December consumer price index (CPI data) are due Friday. Analysts expect a drop of 0.1% in the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cpi-69"" id=""5fc347723131c"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""69"">headline number</a></span>, probably in part due to cheap gas prices. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/core-cpi-56"" id=""5fc34772313b6"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""56"">Core CPI</a></span>, which strips out energy and food, is seen rising 0.2%, according to Briefing.com.</p>
<p>Getting back to the dollar, a weaker greenback might help give multinational U.S. firms a lift, though its still a bit early to see an earnings impact for Q4. More likely any benefits would start to seep into Q1 earnings, because the dollar stayed pretty strong through most of late 2018. Well have to wait and see if this is just a pause in the dollar rally, or perhaps something more prolonged.</p>
<h3><strong>Sentiment Shift On Earnings?</strong></h3>
<p>Its a new year, and maybe that means theres some new sentiment shaping up. Consider the case of homebuilder Lennar (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/lennar"" id=""5fc3477230290"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""7961"">LEN</a></span>), which reported on Wednesday that its Q4 <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/lennar-earnings"" id=""5fc347723144e"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""erl"" data-pairid=""7961"">earnings</a></span> beat Wall Street analysts expectations but revenue missed. Also, the company declined to issue guidance, citing uncertainty about the market. Last year, when companies had any bad news at all, they tended to get punished. So when LEN shares fell right after the earnings, it seemed to carry along the 2018 sentiment.</p>
<p>Then later in the day, LEN shares came back in a big way, rising more than 9% at one point. Instead of punishing the stock, it looks like at least some investors focused more on some of the positives in the companys earnings report and its call with analysts. During the call, LEN said it was seeing improvement in buyer traffic so far in its fiscal Q1 as interest rates declined, Reuters reported. This appeared to be one factor in the stocks rally, and perhaps it indicates improved investor sentiment as earnings season approaches.</p>
<p>A similar situation developed right after the market closed Wednesday, when Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/bed-bath---beyond-inc"" id=""5fc347723034c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""6389"">BBBY</a></span>) stock lifted off in post-market trading following <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/bed-bath---beyond-inc-earnings"" id=""5fc34772314c5"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""erl"" data-pairid=""6389"">earnings</a></span>, though it eased back after the Macys news. The results were pretty much in line with Wall Street analysts expectations. What seemed to get people excited was the companys fiscal 2019 net earnings guidance, which it said would be similar to fiscal 2018 results. So does this mean steady as she goes is now considered enough for a stock to rally? Last year, it seemed like steady guidance or even slightly better guidance sent most companies to the woodshed. This might be something to ponder in the days ahead.</p>
<p>In other corporate news early Thursday, Ford (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/ford-motor-co"" id=""5fc34772303f5"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""255"">F</a></span>) announced job cuts in Europe as the company faces struggles in that market. The company says its move is designed to improve profitability and reduce costs. For investors, the announcement could serve as a signal that the auto industry continues to face challenges, and it also could be another sign of European economic softness.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, American Airlines (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/american-airlines-group"" id=""5fc34772304a4"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""44412"">AAL</a></span>) shares slid in the pre-market after the company cut guidance. The AAL news comes on the back of recent bad news from Delta (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/delta-air-lines-new"" id=""5fc347723054b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8944"">DAL</a></span>) and a major downgrade yesterday on United (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/united-continenta"" id=""5fc34772305eb"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""13061"">UAL</a></span>). Clearly the airlines are having a tough time.</p>
<h3><strong>Volatility Backs Off</strong></h3>
<p>In another sign that sentiment might be changing, the markets most closely watched fear index, the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/volatility-s-p-500"" id=""5fc347723068b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""44336"">VIX</a></span>, edged below 20 on Wednesday for the first time in a month before clawing back above that mark early Thursday. It had traded well above 30 in the week around Christmas as waves of turbulence sent the market up and down like a paper boat in an Atlantic hurricane.</p>
<p>Wednesdays VIX action put the cash price below the next three months of futures prices (see chart below). Until recently, the cash price had been above futures, an unusual trend that in the case of VIX had appeared to indicate high expectations for more near-term volatility. As of Wednesday afternoon, however, the near-term futures contract prices enjoyed a premium to cash, perhaps suggesting that some investors expect relatively calmer times for the moment. Well have to wait and see.</p>

<p><em>Figure 1: Shifting Curves. Hard to believe, but it was a little over two weeks ago, on Christmas Eve, when a market meltdown pushed near-term volatility to its highest levels since February. Yesterday, the first few months of the VIX term structure (aka VIX futures curve) moved back to contango, meaning nearer-term VIX futures (/VX) are priced higher than the cash index. The red line shows the futures curve on December 24; the yellow line shows it as of yesterday's close when the index settled at 19.98. Data source: Cboe Global Markets.

<p><b>Nice Bun But Not a Lot of Beef on Trade: </b>This week brought plenty of positive headlines about trade talks, but not a lot of specifics. While its always nice to hear that China is buying some U.S. products, as it did recently by scooping up another load of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc347723073c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span>, the issues are far more complex than simple product trade. Its unclear if the two countries can make progress on more complicated issues like intellectual property and technology transfers. Then theres the issue of what sort of compliance might be built into any deal. China has made deals in the past, but compliance is sometimes troublesome, as U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross pointed out in a televised interview a few days ago.</p>
<p>The trade talks ended Wednesday in Beijing. Markets appeared to get a shot in the arm as the talks occurred, but the optimism started to fade by Thursday. A lot could hang on whether the two parties schedule another round or retreat to their separate corners for a while. Also, investors might be looking for signs that both China and the U.S. took the same conclusions out of these talks. In the past, there were times when one party offered a different conclusion than the other. So far, that hasnt happened this time, but then again, there also hasnt been much detail offered.</p>
<p><b>Financials Still Not Perking Up Much: </b>A recent rise in risk-on sentiment, with more investors betting against near-term volatility and so-called defensive sectors like utilities and staples taking another hit on Wednesday, hasnt permeated the financial sector in any great way yet. Financials rose slightly Wednesday, but havent shown much zip lately. This could reflect the Treasury yield curve remaining pretty close to flat, though it did tick up slightly at mid-week, perhaps helping the sector a bit. The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/rates-bonds/u.s.-10-year-bond-yield"" id=""5fc34772307dc"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""23705"">10-year yield</a></span>, which ended Wednesday at 2.71%, still has just a 16 basis-point premium to the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/rates-bonds/u.s.-2-year-bond-yield"" id=""5fc3477230876"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""23701"">two-year</a></span>. This situation often makes business tough for some banks, which tend to make money by lending for the long term and paying for short-term deposits. If long-term rates stay low compared with short-term ones, banks margins can come under pressure.</p>
<p>Some analysts say a flatter yield curve tends to hurt smaller banks more than larger ones, so well see late next week what some of the major institutions say when they start putting out Q4 earnings news. It seems like theres a lot of good stuff going on in the financial industry, including what some analysts say are solid credit conditions and strong capital levels. That just hasnt been enough, it seems, to help the sector launch a rally.</p>
<p><b>Small Fry Fly: </b>Back at the end of August, the small-cap <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/smallcap-2000-futures"" id=""5fc3477230909"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8864"">SmallCap 2000</a></span> index (RUT) hit an all-time high of 1742. Then the bottom fell out. By Christmas Eve, the index had dropped 27% to just below 1267, putting it well into bear market territory at 13-month lows. Valuations of small-caps fell to a six-year trough. Its probably too soon to say theres been a turn-around, but since striking that low, the RUT is up more than 13%. On Wednesday, its gains once again outpaced the SPX. Whats interesting here for the broader market is that sometimes small-caps can be a leading indicator. Note how the RUTs troubles preceded the broader market decline, which didnt really get underway until October. Now the RUT is outpacing its big brethren over the last two weeks since the pre-holiday plunge.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, The Wall Street Journal reported that analysts expect double-digit earnings growth for small-cap stocks this year. By contrast, most analysts expect mid-single digit earnings growth for <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/us-spx-500"" id=""5fc34772309a0"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""166"">S&amp;P 500</a></span> companies. One caveat to the small stock bull thesis: Some investors piled into small-caps last summer amid trade war worries, perhaps thinking that small-caps might offer protection because they dont sell so many products into foreign markets. However, if the tariff battle continues, analysts warn that small stocks could still get hit.</p>

Macro analysts think <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc347a9b57f2"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">gold futures</a></span>, which hit new 11-month highs of nearly $1,350 an ounce last week, would lose a chunk of its safe-haven edge in that scenario. However, physical dealers of bullion believe the resulting economic buoyancy will unlock pent-up demand for jewelry.</p>
<h3><strong>Will Crudes V-Shaped Recovery Continue?</strong></h3>
<p><strong></strong></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><strong><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic5a1b9d41c90ed8ec17f4865b4066a2f7.jpeg"" alt=""WTI Daily Chart"" title=""WTI Daily Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">WTI Daily Chart</span></div></strong></div></div><p></p>
<p>As trading in oil settled on Friday, many wondered if its V-shaped recovery would continue as aggressively as the markets crash in the fourth quarter. The musing came as crude experienced a stunning reversal for a second straight week from the doldrums that had shackled U.S.  WTI in the $51-$53 range and U.K. Brent within $61 to $63.</p>
<p>One reason for oils explosive performance now is speculation that Washington and Beijing were nearing the end of their trade war, heightened by U.S. President Donald Trumps meeting with China's Vice Premier Liu He on Friday, on the sidelines of bilateral talks that officials from both sides said were going well.</p>
<p>Yet a resolution to the U.S.-China standoff could be both bullish and bearish to oil and other commodities.</p>
<p>Firstly, a trade deal could come with a large Chinese order of U.S. crude to appease Washington.</p>
<p>Without the hundreds of billions of dollars of tariffs slapped on Chinese goods by the Trump administration, confidence will build again on growth prospects for the worlds No. 2 economy, boosting risk appetite across markets. Beijing might even resort to economic pump priming to hasten its recovery, further fueling investor fervor.</p>
<h3><strong>Highs Generated On Oil Could Fizzle</strong></h3>
<p>But like all other market euphoria that ultimately fades, the highs generated by a trade deal could also fizzle without commensurate data from Chinaor, in oils case, demand specifically for crude.</p>
<p>U.S. crude productionalready the worlds most substantial, at 12 million barrels per daycould continue ramping to overshoot the 13 million bpd forecast for 2020 by this year.</p>
<p>The U.S. output surge could offset OPEC exports cuts led by Saudi Arabia. While U.S. crude is a lighter variant of the heavier oil produced in the Middle East, in the global scheme of things, its total supply that will matter, some analysts argued.</p>
<p>As Scott Shelton, energy futures broker at ICAP) in Durham, N.C., observed on Friday, the trade deal could be the last shoe to drop on the oil market.</p>
<p>Shelton, one of the more pragmatic bulls in oil, believes some of the hedge funds behind this year's 25% rally in crude are really market neutral over the next three to six months. He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""The question is whether or not they will get long.""</p>
<p>""Spending another week above the 100-Day Moving Average may generate that as the market confirms the level, but I am dubious about the general macro.""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wonder what will be next to drive the bullish rhetoric.""</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Dubious Commodity Victories</strong></h3>
<p>Other analysts raised the specter of hollow victories in commodities being made to sound bigger than they were.</p>
<p>One case in point: Trumps supporters tweeting excitedly at the weekend about Beijings intended purchase of 10 million bushels of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc347a9b58b7"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">U.S. soybeans</a></span>, when data showed China buying as much as 36 million bushels annually before the trade war began.</p>
<p>South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem said Friday retaliatory tariffs on U.S. commodities like soybeans and wheat <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc347a9b595f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">wheat</a></span> from Trumps tit-for-tat wars with China and the European Union have devastated her states economy and its large agricultural practice.</p>
<p>Noem added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Farmers are used to risk, theyre used to prices going up and down and having that, but this sustained low commodity prices, frankly, is driving a lot of family businesses out of business.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>A More Hawkish Fed After Trade Deal?</strong></h3>
<p>For investors in gold, Wednesday will be a big day as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell makes his <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/fed-chair-powell-testifies-1739"" id=""5fc347a9b5b88"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1739"">semi-annual testimony</a></span> before a House panel, offering a glimpse of the central banks thinking amid winds of change in the global economy.</p>

<p>Even as precious metals analysts factored in the potential for higher jewelry demand from a recovering Chinese economy, the bigger element for goldthe safe-haven edge kept alive by the trade warhas faded with the likelihood of a deal happening with the U.S. soon.</p>
<p>Stronger Chinese growth forecasts could lift inflation expectations and revisions to global GDP, prompting the hitherto dovish Fed to turn hawkish again.</p>

Customs data from China showed its crude oil imports for September were 2.2% lower than a month earlier at 41.2 million tons.</p>
<p>Russias energy minister Alexander Novak was in Jeddah yesterday to sign a long-term charter with OPEC. He commented that it was important that OPEC+ can react quickly to market changes. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia said that all damages from the September 14 attacks had been repaired and that production was back to pre-attack levels at 9.9 million barrels per day (bpd). The number of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/u.s.-baker-hughes-oil-rig-count-1652"" id=""5fc34891e7a5d"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1652"">U.S. rigs</a></span> producing oil rose for the first time in eight weeks, hitting 712 as at last Friday.</p>
<p>Speculative accounts trimmed net long positions for a fourth straight week in the week to October 8, the latest data from CFTC show. Net longs are now the lowest since the week of June 11.</p>
<p>West Texas Intermediate (WTI) remains capped by the 55- and 100-day moving averages at $55.40 and $55.73 respectively. The 100-day average has capped prices on a closing basis since September 24.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/natural-gas"" id=""5fc34891e7340"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8862"">NATURAL GAS</a></span></strong> is in the process of staging a recovery from the seven-week lows struck last Friday amid forecasts for colder weather across the U.S. in the October 19-23 period. Prices have risen for the past three days and are edging toward the 55- and 100-day moving averages at 2.3229 and 2.3281, respectively.</p>

Last weeks inventory data to October 4 showed a smaller total of 98 billion cubic feet (bcf) compared with 112 bcf the previous week. Thats still above the 5-year average of 89 bcf.</p>
<h2><strong>Precious metals</strong></h2><p></p>

The deal is seen as a major breakthrough and paves the way for a partial trade deal, though China have been quick to state that a lot of work still needs to be done. The improvement in sentiment took its toll on gold and the Thursday/Friday losses tipped the precious metal into negative for the week. Its still trading within the downward-sloping channel mentioned last week, with the outer limits now approximately at 1,447 and 1,513.</p>
<p>Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) added to gold holdings for a 20th session, Bloomberg reported yesterday. Thats the longest buying streak in a decade.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/silver"" id=""5fc34891e747e"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8836"">SILVER</a></span></strong> has fared a tad better than gold, rallying for the past three days with exchange-traded funds adding to their existing holdings for the past six sessions, according to Bloomberg reports, bringing total net purchases for 2019 to 108 million ounces. Speculative investors had also been net bullish at the last reporting date on October 8, turning net buyers for the first time in five weeks, according to CFTC data.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/platinum"" id=""5fc34891e752d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8910"">PLATINUM</a></span></strong> continues its retreat from two-week highs as the metal struggles to sustain a move above the 55-day moving average attempted on Thursday. That moving average is now at 898.65 with platinum currently trading at 894.48.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/palladium"" id=""5fc34891e75d5"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8883"">PALLADIUM</a></span></strong> reached a new record high yesterday as the implications for some sort of trade deal boosted the metal. The assumption is that a deal would improve the prospects for global growth, which in turn would increase demand for cars and hence boost demand for the metal in pollution control devices in those cars.</p>
<p>Speculative investors were well positioned for the latest record-breaking rally, having increased net long positions for the past six weeks, lifting net longs to the highest in more than seven months.</p><div class=""outerEleWrapper"">

However, copper imports were a bright spot in the report, rising to the highest this year at 445,000 tons, but still down 15% from a year earlier. Copper stocks at warehouses monitored by the London Metal Exchange (LME) were higher for a second straight week, the first time this has happened since July.</p>
<p>Speculative investors remain a bit skeptical about the industrial metals rise, having increased net short positions for a third straight week, according to the latest report to October 8 from CFTC. Net shorts are now at a five-week high.</p>
<h2><strong>Agriculturals</strong></h2><p>U.S. President Trump said that China has agreed to increase purchases of U.S. agricultural products to $40-$50 billion annually under the Phase 1 trade agreement. This compares with the 2017 U.S. exports total of $19.5 billion.</p>
<p>It was inevitable therefore that agricultural commodities rose, with <strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34891e7727"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">SOYBEANS</a></span></strong> an outperformer. The commodity hit a 16-month high of 9.38 yesterday, having risen for seven consecutive days. Soybeans were given an additional boost from the recent World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture on Friday, which pegged U.S. soybean supply lower than expected.</p>
<p>Speculative investors were already bullish on the commodity prior to the latest surge, having boosted net long positions for a fourth straight week to hit the highest since June 2018.</p><div class=""outerEleWrapper"">

The rally hit the 100-day moving average at 3.9568 but failed to trade above it. That moving average has capped prices for nine weeks. Speculative investors trimmed net short positions for a second straight week, reducing them to the lowest since September 3.</p>

The International Sugar Organisation (ISO) has pegged the 2019/20 season deficit at nearly five million tons, which is helping to support prices. However, the shortfall comes after two straight years of surpluses and the ISO reckons there is still a 95 million ton backlog to clear.</p>

Prices have stalled near the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the drop from June 27 to September 3 at 5.109 and could be facing their first down-day in three today.</p>
<p>Speculative investors turned net sellers of the commodity for the first time in five weeks, according to data as at October 8 from CFTC. Net shorts are now at the highest since early-June.</p>

<p>Prior to the breakout, speculative investors had added to net long positions for a second straight week in the week to May 7, boosting net longs to the highest since the week of April 9, according to the latest <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-gold-speculative-net-positions-1618"" id=""5fc34810d1d28"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1618"">CFTC</a></span> data. As per last Friday, gold held by Exchange-Traded Funds was the lowest total since December.</p>
<p><strong>SILVER</strong> continues to trade below the 200-day moving average, as it has done all month. The gold/silver (Mint) ratio has been catapulted to more than decade highs as gold surged, and is now at 87.80. The lack of upward momentum for silver compared to gold would be pleasing to speculative investors, since net short positioning is at its highest since December.</p>
<p><strong>PLATINUM</strong> has been meandering so far this week, with no discernable near-term trend evident. The precious metal is trading between the 100-day moving average support at 838.38 and the 55-day moving average resistance at 863.89. Speculative investors scaled back their bullish bets on the metal from 13-month highs in the week to May 7, the latest data from CFTC shows.</p>
<p>In a report released yesterday, the World Platinum Investment Council stated that a surge in demand from institutional investors has reduced the projected 2019 platinum surplus to 375,000 ounces from 680,000 in March.</p>
<p><strong>PALLADIUM</strong> is attempting a rebound from four-month lows this week after posting the biggest one-day gain in more than four years on Friday, which snapped a four-day losing streak. The latest data from CFTC shows that speculative investors reduced net long positions for the first time in three weeks in the week to May 7. The trend of gradually reducing bullish bets started back at the end of February.</p>
<h3><strong>Base metals</strong></h3>
<p>The deterioration in the US-China trade talks and its impact on future growth and hence raw material consumption has hit<strong> COPPER</strong> hard, pressing it to the lowest levels since January 29. This month has seen some of the worst daily losses since July/August and the industrial metal is now languishing at 2.7279, just above yesterdays low of 2.6996.</p>
<p>Speculative investors were net sellers of the metal in the week to May 7, boosting net short positions to the highest since the week of January 29.</p>
<h3><strong>Energy</strong></h3>
<p><strong>NATURAL GAS</strong> is still holding below the 55-day moving average, an average that has capped prices since December 24. Traders are currently weighing forecasts of warmer weather along the US east coast against cooler weather in the west. Last weeks EIA <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/natural-gas"" id=""5fc34810d18ac"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8862"">natural gas</a></span> storage stockpiles showed an addition of 85 billion cubic feet, broadly in line with expectations, and the sixth weekly increase in a row. Economists forecasts for this week show an expected addition of 93 billion cubic feet to stockpiles.</p>
<p>A victim of the latest tariff hikes by China is imports of US Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). Reuters reports that so far this year only two US cargoes of LNG have been shipped to China compared with 14 in the first four months of 2018. China boosted tariffs on LNG to 25% from 10% effective June 1.</p>
<p><strong>CRUDE OIL</strong> prices came under pressure yesterday as China retaliated with tariff increases on US imported goods. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell 1.45% to test the 55-day moving average at $60.65. The 200-day moving average is also lurking below at $60.43. WTI is currently trading at $61.08.</p>

<p>Prices fell despite reported attacks on two Saudi Arabian tankers in the Persian Gulf. Speculation abounds that Iran had a hand in the affair, and this has raised fears of an escalating conflict in the main oil production area of the world and its consequences for global oil supply.</p>
<p>Speculative investors reduced net long positions for a second straight week in the week to May 7, the latest data snapshot from <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-crude-oil-speculative-net-positions-1653"" id=""5fc34810d1dbf"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1653"">CFTC</a></span> shows.</p>

<p><strong>WHEAT</strong> looks set to rise for a second straight day today as the commodity rebounds from 16-month lows struck early yesterday. Prices may be eyeing the 55-day moving average at 4.444, which has capped trading since February 14.</p>

<p>The rebound comes despite last Fridays report from the US Department of Agriculture which forecast <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc34810d1ba9"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">US wheat</a></span> inventories would balloon to a 30-year high in the next season, as more farmers switch away from soy to wheat, which is less dependent on China demand. The same report sees Russian production increasing 7.4% in the same season.</p>
<p>Speculative investors trimmed their net short positions for the first time in four weeks, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-wheat-speculative-net-positions-1812"" id=""5fc34810d1e4f"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1812"">CFTC</a></span> data to May 7 shows.</p>
<p><strong>SUGAR</strong> prices may also be trying to build a base, with this months low so far matching the low seen in January. There may be some supply-side difficulties in the pipeline, with the heavy rains being experienced in Brazil raising fears that export shipments may be delayed. Meanwhile, the USDA report on Friday predicted that Indias sugar output would fall 8.4% in the 2019/20 season which starts in October. US production is seen increasing just 1.9% year-on-year for the same period.</p>
<p><strong>SOYBEAN</strong> prices look set to snap a four-day losing streak today, potentially only the second up-day so far this month. Prices touched the lowest in almost a decade yesterday when the 55-day moving average moved below the 200-day moving average for the first time since February 4. Speculative investors reduced net short positioning for the first time in four weeks in the week to May 7, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-soybeans-speculative-net-positions-1811"" id=""5fc34810d1ed9"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1811"">CFTC</a></span> data shows.</p>
<p>Brazil looks poised to overtake the US as the worlds top soy grower again in the 2019/20 season. The last time this happened was in the 2017/18 season. When it comes to exports however, Brazil has been top of the league above the US since 2012/13.</p>
<p><strong>CORN</strong> is also on the rebound after touching eight-month lows yesterday. The upmove comes despite the latest US Department of Agriculture WASDE report predicting bumper US production for the 2019/20 season, with season-end stocks seen up nearly 19% from the previous season. However, exports were seen dropping 2.7% to 36 million tons. Corn is up almost 6% from yesterdays low and is now at 3.529.</p>

<p>On the daily chart, the PCI instrument <b>&amp;Grain_4: D1</b> is consolidating near the lower boundary of the uptrend. The Parabolic indicator continues giving sell signal, while MACD has formed a signal to buy. The Bollinger bands? have widened a lot, which may mean higher volatility. The RSI has formed small positive divergence. The bullish momentum may develop if the PCI surpasses the upper Parabolic signal, the Bollinger Band and the last fractal high at 368. This level may serve the point of entry. The initial risk-limit may be placed below the two last fractal lows at 347. Having opened the pending order, we shall move the stop to the next fractal low following the Parabolic and Bollinger signals. Thus, we are changing the probable profit/loss ratio to the breakeven point. The most risk-averse traders may switch to the 4-hour chart after the trade and place there a stop-loss moving it in the direction of the trade. If the price meets the stop-loss level at 347 without reaching the order at 368, we recommend cancelling the position: the market sustains internal changes which were not taken into account.</p>

Theres another grain thats quickly finding favor with investors now, though with not as much fanfare: wheat.</p>
<p>Droughts in Ukraine and Spain, torrential downpour in France and more rains in the U.S. Great Plains have combined to slash the global output of wheat, the raw material for making bread, pasta, cookies, flours, industrial starch and alcohol.</p>
<h3><strong>Fund Buying Ramps Up In Wheat As Growing Conditions Worsen</strong></h3>
<p>Jack Scoville, analyst at Chicagos Price Futures Group and author of the brokerages daily grains report, said funds had ramped up their buying in wheat in recent weeks as uncertain growing conditions around the world continued.</p>
<p>Said Scoville: Chicago was the upside leader (in funds support), implying big speculative buying interest.</p>

The rally in May18%was its best in three years.</p>
<p>Year-to-date, CBOT wheat is up 6%.</p>
<p>In contrast, corn futures had their best month in 8 years in May when they rose 21% on delayed plantings from inclement weather. Year-to-date, CBOT corn is up 18%, making it the best-performing agricultural market of 2019.</p>
<h3><strong>Wheat Technicals Show It Could Close The Gap With Corn</strong></h3>
<p>Still, wheats technicals indicate that it could play some more catch up with corn.</p>
<p>Technical analysts have pegged a Strong Buy for the front-month July corn contract on CBOT, citing a resistance as high as $5.5162 per bushel. At Thursdays settlement of $5.344 per bushel, that indicates a further upside of 3% or more.</p>
<p>Wheats outlook got another boost on Thursday after crop consultancy Strategie Grains cut by more than 1 million tons its forecast for E.U. soft wheat exports to third countries for the 2019/20 season.</p>
<p>Said the consultancy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""The outlook here has actually worsened since last month thanks to the new increase for Ukraines exportable surplus, given that Ukrainian wheat is a main competitor of E.U. wheat.</p>
<p>""At current prices, France would export less wheat than in 2018/19 although the northern E.U. countries C Germany, Lithuania, Latvia C would perform solidly, assuming that their harvests rebound in line with current forecasts (dry conditions in the Baltic countries are currently causing concern).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Various factors have contributed to the deterioration of Europes soft wheat crop, including a drought in Spain and more dry and hot conditions through the end of the growth cycle on the eastern side of the E.U. thats home to Baltic countries such as Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia.</p>
<p>Above-average rainfall was also beginning to set off alarm bells in Hungary, Italy and, to a lesser extent, Romania, Bulgaria and France, where conditions overall have been good so far this season.</p>
<p>France, the E.U.'s largest wheat exporter, has, meanwhile, experienced above-average rainfall.</p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

<p>Going into 2019, analysts think corn would be a better sell than a buy. Shawn Hackett of Hackett Financial Advisors, an agricultural markets advisory in Boca Raton, Florida, is convinced investors should short corn now in order to have a chance of making money in the new year.</p>
<h3><strong>Supply Disruption Needed For More Price Upside</strong></h3>
<p>Hacketts reasoning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is hard to see the corn market exhibiting substantial upside form here unless Mother Nature were to pay a nasty visit in South America or if the wheat market were to take off. We are bullish wheat but still feel corn would underperform in that scenario.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Corn, which began the year at $3.5075 per bushel, hit a two-year high of $4.1225 in May before consolidating to current levels of around $3.84 on the benchmark March futures contract.</p>
<p>Hackett said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Smart money in the corn market continues to see selling and is traveling down a more bearish path. A combined smart money sell signal is very close to being triggered. Prices are pressed against major overhead resistance near $390 basis the March contract.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>This Years Massive Export Demand May Not Recur</strong></h3>
<p>According to Hackett, the run-up was primarily driven by massive export demand for US-grown corn, owing to poor crops in South America and the EU. He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This has occurred at time when US farmers tend to lock corn up in the bin until the new year, requiring higher prices to force sales.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hackett said that although the export trend could continue a while longer,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So long as South American corn production looks as good as it does now, we will start to see new fresh supplies competing for global export market share in a few months.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This deceleration in US exports will come at a time that talk will be circling around large increases in US corn planted acres for the 2019 growing season. We may be close to the first good opportunity to sell corn here. As always, we will wait patiently for a formal smart money sell signal to be triggered. Bottom-line  Get ready to sell corn.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>A Corrective Pullback Could Lead To 'Nice' Buying Opportunity</strong></h3>
<p>Dan Hueber, who authors the Hueber Report out of St. Charles, Illinois, has a similar view:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am of the opinion that corn is due for a corrective pullback and if such a move materializes into early January, we could be presented with a nice purchase opportunity at that time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jack Scoville, grains analyst at The Price Futures Group brokerage in Chicago, noted that corn seemed to find increased selling interest whenever prices approached $3.90 per bushel on the March contract.</p>
<h3><strong>US Supply-Demand For Corn Not Too Thrilling</strong></h3>
<p>Scoville said while the latest weekly export demand numbers for corn from the US Department of Agriculture were supportive, they were somewhat disappointing too, falling short of the million ton threshold. Likewise, supply data published by the USDA also provided no surprises, with production from major competing centers, including Brazil, Argentina and Russia, remaining subdued amid benign weather.</p>
<p>Scoville added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The US should remain the dominant seller in the world Corn and feed grains market for the next several months due to limited competition from South America and the Black Sea area.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Buy, Say Some, As $4 Corn Is Coming</strong></h3>
<p>Some, like Mike Seery of Seery Futures in Plainfield, Illinois, are more bullish on corn going into 2019. Said Seery:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Im certainly not recommending any type of bearish position, with the next major resistance at the $3.90 level. I think there's a possibility corn could trade in the low $4 range soon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seery reasons that with the market above its 100-Day Moving Average, the immediate trend was higher:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My only concern is that there is a price gap that was created between $3.78 / $3.80, as I think that will be filled before a true bullish trend will develop.</p>

There is still a global shortage of the metal and demand is seen increasing, so any downward correction is seen as only temporary.</p>

This could give a clearer picture of the prospects for global growth and hence demand for the industrial metal.</p>

<h3><strong>Energy</strong></h3>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc3478be3703"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">Crude oil</a></span> posted its biggest one-day decline in a month yesterday amid demand concerns from a global economic slowdown and an increase in supply. The number of U.S. drilling rigs in operation increased for the first time this year, according to weekly data released last Friday. Furthermore, EIA stockpiles data showed an inventory build of 7.97 million barrels in the week to January 18 versus an expected drawdown of 42,000 barrels.</p>
<p>In addition, speculation grew yesterday that the U.S. government was considering releasing oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve in order to coincide with possible sanctions imposed on Venezuela exports, according to industry benchmark and information provider Platts. Meanwhile, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the Venezuelan crisis has had zero impact on the oil market so far, while Saudi oil production will likely be well below the voluntary cap for a full six months.</p>

Freezing weather is gripping most of the U.S. Midwest as arctic air circulates. The freezing weather caused a drawdown of natural gas inventories of 163 billion cubic meters in the week to January 18, according to EIA, the biggest reduction since February last year. Despite this demand, gas prices remain sluggish, hitting the lowest since January 3 yesterday, which in turn was the lowest since October. Gas is now at 2.974.</p>

Prices touched the 55-day moving average for the first time in three weeks and are now at 0.1261. One of Indias top exporters said the country is expected to continue with sugar exports in the 2019-20 season, adding to an existing global glut. In addition, Kenya announced that its 2018 production jumped 31% to 491,000 tons.</p>

An extended dry spell in Brazil and heavier-than-normal rainfall in Argentina are raising concerns about a supply deficit from the region, though this was compensated somewhat by reports that Canada expected to produce 33 million tons of wheat in the 2019-20 season, a 3.9% increase from a year ago. Wheat is now at 5.106 with the combination of 55-, 100- and 200-day moving averages slowing rising to meet current prices, creating a support window in the 5.0105-5.0454 area.</p>

Both sides will likely put a positive spin on the next round of US-China trade talks and the mere fact that there are talks unlike, say six months ago, is constructive, as are reports of continued Chinese demand for <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc347898df89"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">US wheat</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc347898e041"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soy</a></span>.

<p><strong>Dollar Index:</strong> In response to a more dovish than expected ECB and the BOJ's forecast cut, the Dollar Index was lifted to its best level since January 3. It came within a tick of meeting the 61.8% retracement of the decline since the high from last year, recorded in the middle of December (near 97.70). The pre-weekend sell-off took it to two-week lows (January 15) and through the 20-day moving average. Initial support is seen in the 95.50-95.65 area. A break sets up a test on the low for the month set on January 10 near 95.00. The MACDs and Slow Stochastics are poised to turn lower. The 200-day moving average, which the Dollar Index has traded above since last May, is found near 95.20.</p>
<p><strong>Euro:</strong> In the first half of January, the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/eur-usd"" id=""5fc347898e108"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""1"">euro</a></span> broke its $1.13-$1.15 trading range to the upside, reaching $1.1575. It proved a false break, and last week the euro slipped briefly below the $1.13 in response to the ECB meeting and Draghi's press conference. However, that break was also no sustained, as we had anticipated. The euro finished at the highs for the week above $1.14. The session came to an end with the euro stalling near the 20-day moving average a little above $1.1415. The nearby technical targets cited around $1.1430 and $1.1465. The risk-reward changes as the upper end of the range ($1.15) is approached.</p>
<p><strong>Yen:</strong> The dollar tried in vain to push above JPY110. The poor close ahead of the weekend warns the market may be giving up. There looks to be a bearish divergence in the RSI and the Slow Stochastics are about to turn lower. A break of JPY109.30 may be an early signal of further losses. Initial support is seen near JPY108.80 with stronger support, not until JPY108.00.</p>
<p><strong>Sterling:</strong> It would seem to confound logic, but sterling rose 2.5% last week to extend its advance for the sixth consecutive week. It was the largest weekly gain since last September and the highest level since October 11. The risk of a no-deal exit is perceived to have fallen sharply. We are concerned that sentiment has run ahead of the events, though the technical indicators, while stretched, have not turned lower. The next important chart points are found near $1.34 and $1.36. Prime Minister May has not escaped the scissors the UK is stuck in: the closer she moves to parliament, the more distance between the UK and the EC opens. May's Plan B if approved by Parliament has already been rejected by the EC, and when it does so again, it would seem to be sterling negative. If it does not pass, it is difficult to see it as a reason to buy sterling. A break below $1.30 may be the first sign a top is in place.</p>
<p><strong>Canadian Dollar: </strong>The US dollar's recovery from the slide in the first part of January stalled near CAD1.3375, but it was the reversal ahead of the weekend the saw the greenback post a 0.3% loss for the week. The dollar-bloc led that reversal, but the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-cad"" id=""5fc347898e1b4"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""7"">Canadian dollar</a></span> was the laggard. Still, the close was poor, and the dollar seems set to test support in the CAD1.3180-CAD1.3200 area. If that gives way, the next target would be near CAD1.3120. This seems exaggerated, and the widening the of the two-year interest rate differential to 73 bp before the weekend, the most since before Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>Australian Dollar: </strong> The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/aud-usd"" id=""5fc347898e25e"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""5"">Australian dollar</a></span> posted a key reversal ahead of the weekend by first making new lows for the move (~$0.7075) and then proceeding to rally and close above the previous day's high. Resistance is seen at $0.7200 and then $0.7240. Like we saw with the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar's complete retracement of its losses came despite a sharp widening in the US two-year premium over Australia as the market priced in an increased likelihood of an RBA rate cut.</p>
<p><strong>Mexican Peso: </strong> The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-mxn"" id=""5fc347898e30c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""39"">Mexican peso</a></span> trends. It rose against the dollar last week for the ninth consecutive week. Before this rally, the peso fell for eight weeks. Ahead of the weekend the dollar tested and held above the low set earlier this month a little below MXN18.88. There is little chart support below MXN18.80 until around MXN18.50. Mexico is expecting slower growth (0.2% quarter-over-quarter after 0.8% in Q3) and contracting (sub-50) <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/manufacturing-pmi-1303"" id=""5fc347898f86c"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1303"">manufacturing</a></span> and non-manufacturing PMIs for the third consecutive month in January. Its high interest rates continue to draw interest. A move above last week's high near MXN19.25 would lend credence to ideas that a bottom is being carved.</p>
<p><strong>Oil:</strong> For two and a half weeks the March light sweet <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc347898e3bd"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">crude oil</a></span> futures contract has chopped between $50 and $55 a barrel. Last week it finished off 0.65% to snap a three-week advance. The losses would have been larger if it weren't for the 1% rally ahead of the weekend spurred by concerns of the supply disruptions posed by the turmoil in Venezuela. There appears to be a potential head and shoulders bottom pattern, with $55 being the neckline and the object is near $67. The weekly Slow Stochastics and MACDs have only recently turned up from oversold. The weekly RSI signaled the advance may showing a bulling divergence at the end of last year.</p>
<p><strong>US Rates: </strong>The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/rates-bonds/u.s.-10-year-bond-yield"" id=""5fc347898e471"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""23705"">10-year</a></span> yield traded between 2.70% and 2.80%, which translates roughly 122-123 basis the March futures contract. With the government re-opening, an economic risk has been removed, and we suspect the short-term market is vulnerable to a push higher in yields. The technical indicators favor further losses for the futures contract, with scope for a full point range-extension toward 121. The July Fed funds futures contract implies an average effective rate of 2.465%, which is equivalent to a 30% chance of a 20 bp increase in H1 19.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/us-spx-500"" id=""5fc347898e516"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""166"">S&amp;P 500</a></span>: </strong>The S&amp;P 500 gapped higher on January 18, and it was closed the following session, confirming it was what is considered a normal gap. After pulling back from 2675 to almost 2612, the S&amp;P 500 found a bid and gapped higher on January 25. The RSI is moving higher, so are the MACDs, but they are stretched, and the Slow Stochastics have already turned lower. The re-opening of the government and the next round of trade talks are favorable, while the FOMC is sidelined for the next several months, at least and Q4 GDP and the January jobs data is unlikely to change that judgment.</p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

<p dir=""ltr"">Can both be achieved?</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Yes, say rice analysts and traders, who add that the two are quite distinct targets.</p>
<p>One is the futures price, which is the price US farmers get for their rice, said Shawn Hackett of Boca Raton, Florida-based agricultural markets consultancy Hackett Financial Advisors. The other is the price that US rice is sold to the world at.</p>
<h3>Rough Year Thus Far For Rice Futures</h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">It has been a rough year for US rice futures, beset with volatility since they hit a near 7 percent gain in January.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">In Mondays trade, the most active November rice contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange settled at $10.92 per cwt. While that puts it up nearly 1 percent for this month, its only a modest recovery from a 9 percent drop in August. If the market retains its upward trek, it would be its third month of gains in four. Yet for the year, it is down almost 6 percent. Hackett said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir=""ltr"">But all these might be changing as we see sizeable buy-signals in rice right now as we approach harvest season...We traded consistently in the $12.00-$12.50 (cwt) range in the first half of the year. Thats certainly a target to revisit. It would also be typical for a post-harvest rally.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Jack Scoville, lead grains trader for Price Futures Group in Chicago, said he expects the market to be restrained for a while before picking up to reach between $11.50 and $11.75 cwt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir=""ltr"">There seems to be very good crop in Texas and Louisiana, and were starting to expand in places like Arkansas too. I think thats going to keep the market under a little bit of a pressure here over the next two to three weeks, before a breakout can happen.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Strong Buy Call On Technicals</h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">Backing the prognosis for higher futures prices is Investing.coms daily technical outlook, which has an immediate Strong Buy on US rough rice. The recommendation shifts to a sell only when the November contract reaches between the 50-day moving average of $11.262 and 200-day average of $11.993.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Technicals aside, global rice output may be limited next year by the 2019/2020 El Nino weather phenomenon that could bring drought and stress to crops in Asia.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The US-Mexico Free Trade Agreement <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/news/economy-news/trump-announces-us-mexico-bilateral-trade-agreement-gets-rid-of-nafta-name-1588069"" id=""5fc344356b7e6"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""oal"" data-articleid=""1588069"">announced last month</a></span> could also be shaping as a positive for rice. Hackett added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir=""ltr"">While rice was never really under the threat of Mexican tariffs before that Agreement, the sum effect of the deal is that its become a fundamental boost for all grains traded between the two countries...And that includes rice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir=""ltr"">Nathan Childs, senior rice economist at the USDA Economic Research Service, was quoted telling <a href=""https://www.deltafarmpress.com/rice/us-rice-farmers-losing-market-share-mexico-latin-america"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">an agricultural Webinar</a> recently that US rice exports had potential to rise by 13 percent in the 2018-19 marketing year. But that still fell short of their true reach, he added. The reason for that: Venezuelan, Chilean and Paraguayan rice, which were more competitively priced than the American product.</p>
<h3>Export Challenges</h3>
<p>Childs used Mexicothe largest buyer of US rice, which purchased 900,000 metric tons in 2017as a reference. The US was probably once 99 percent or a rock solid 95 (percent in control of the Mexican market). Were probably not even at 80 percent of that market now.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While US rice shipments to its northern neighbor has eroded, South American exporters continue to gain market share in Mexico, said Childs, adding that American export prices had to drop to bridge the difference.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">USDA <a href=""https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/89833/rcs-18h.pdf?v=0"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">records on rice shipments</a> show that exporters had been cutting back on prices, though not as much as desired. The California 2017/18 all-rice season average farm price (SAFP), for instance, was lowered to $16.60 per cwt in August from July $16.70. Yet, the quote was well above the $14.10 for California SAFP through 2016/17.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Hackett said export prices were largely determined by <a href=""https://www.riceland.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Riceland Foods</a>, the world's largest miller and marketer of rice that buys the bulk of the grain from American farmers before processing it for shipment. The relative export price to farm has to contract on Ricelands end if we are to achieve the shipment potential desired by the USDA.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Mark Holt, a rice export division official at Riceland, did not immediately respond to Investing.coms request for comment.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Scoville argued however that US rice was pretty fairly priced for its quality:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Its normal for both futures and export prices to come down this time of year because of harvest...But I dont think we have to stay there to attract business. I think even at these current prices, weve been doing business and I think well continue to do that.</p>

<p></p><p>Since the U.S. president promised in October that China will buy $50 billion or more of farm products from the United States a year under the phase one of their trade agreement, grain markets belief in an imminent deal has turned from hope to prayer and, finally, despair.</p><p></p>
<p>So, when Trump announced on Tuesday that a pact with China will likely come after 2020to deprive Beijing of any advantage it may have in pressuring him for a settlement in its favor before next Novembers U.S. presidential electionthere was an almost discernible yawn from the agricultural trading community.</p><!--start-image-->

<!--end-image--><p>The U.S. soybeans marketpoised to be the biggest beneficiary of any China dealsurprisingly closed in the positive, after 10 days in the red, suggesting relief that the trade ballyhoo was finally over and the market could go back to focusing on some real fundamentals. </p>
<p>The trade war rumbles are front and center, but thankfully grain markets appear to be looking beyond that news, said Dan Hueber, founder of The Hueber Report, a St. Charles, Illinois-based agricultural risk consultancy. </p>
<p></p><p>Hueber noted that the delayed China deal wasnt the only bad news in commodity markets on Tuesday. Less than 24 hours earlier, the Trump administration had also announced tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports from Brazil and Argentina, and threatened up to 100% duties on $2.4 billion of French cheese, champagne and other products.</p><p></p>
<p>Soybeans aside, U.S. corn prices also fell modestly on Tuesday. Only wheat got crushed but that was probably due to the fact it had been overbought recently on fears of tight supply, said traders.</p>
<p>Added Hueber: </p>
<p></p><blockquote>I suspect tariff fatigue is becoming more and more ingrained within the psyche of the trade. </blockquote><p></p>
<p>On the contrary, equity markets were more unsettled by Trumps China announcement, Hueber noted, with stocks on Wall Street suffering their biggest daily loss in two months.</p>
<p>So, where would U.S. soybeans trade fundamentally if big buyer China is out of the equationa prospect looking increasingly likely after Dec .15, when the Trump administration and government of President Xi Jinping exchange even more punitive tariffs?</p>
<p>According to Investing.coms Daily Technical Outlook, Chicago-traded <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc348b2d317e"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybean futures</a></span> for January delivery remain in a Strong Sell position. Yet, theres potential for the contract to test $8.8336 per bushel in a rebound, versus Tuesdays settlement of $8.7275.</p>
<p>Said Jack Scoville, who heads grains analysis at Chicago brokerage Price Futures Group:</p>
<p></p><blockquote>The U.S. harvest is entering its final stages now and many producers are putting their soybeans into storage and not selling. This has caused basis levels for soy to firm in the country and at the Gulf of Mexico.</blockquote><p></p>
<p>Scoville concurs with Hueber that the market is tired of hearing about the potential U.S.-China trade deal, and wants to see the real thing. </p>
<p>In the case of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc348b2d33d8"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">corn futures</a></span>, Investing.coms Daily Technical Outlook holds a Strong Buy recommendation for the March contract, forecasting a top-end resistance of $3.8820 per bushel versus Tuesdays settlement of $3.8150.</p>
<p>While March corn hasnt broken through key resistance, it continues to flirt with resistance around the $3.83 mark, said Hueber.</p>
<p></p><blockquote>Indicators have turned higher, and we may close above the 21-day moving average. The path of least resistance should be transitioning to the upside.</blockquote><p></p>
<p>For March <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc348b2d34a0"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">wheat futures</a></span>, Investing.coms recommendation is Neutral, with top-end resistance at $5.5294 per bushel and firmest support at $5.0272. Tuesdays close was $5.2538.</p>
<p>Said Scoville: </p>
<p></p><blockquote>World wheat prices will still be dictated by what happens in Europe and the Black Sea area, and U.S. prices will most likely remain a follower as the U.S. tries to compete for sales. Chart patterns on daily and weekly charts imply more up pressure on prices this week though.</blockquote><p></p>
<p>Crop fundamentals aside, fund alignment in grains could also turn positive, pushing prices higher. </p>
<p>Added Hueber:</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
<p>It would come as no surprise to anyone watching the soybean market as of late that speculative funds have been sellers, and as it turned out, they sold a record quantity.""</p>

El Nino weather pattern, which arises as Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures rise above normal levels and change regular wind patterns causing draughts and floods, can severely impact crop harvests around the globe. <br>El Nino conditions are present and El Nino will likely peak during the Northern Hemisphere winter 2015/16 and weather conditions will transition to neutral during the late spring or early summer 2016, according to US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. And World Meteorological Organization expects this El Nino will be the biggest in more than 15 years. <br>Australia, the worlds largest <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc346703c7ef"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">wheat</a></span> exporter, cut its crop outlook by 5.2% for the 20015/16 season ending in July 1, 2016 to 23.98 million tonnes from its previous estimate in September of 25.28 million tonnes due to dry weather, frost and fire damage. However, wheat crop is expected to exceed marginally last seasons output.</p>
<p>Low rainfall and drought have resulted in poor harvests in Africa and Central America, particularly in Ethiopia, Malawi, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua, along with Haiti and southeastern Brazil, resulting in higher food prices due to widespread damage to crops. World Food Program of UN estimates 13.1 million people in East Africa and Central America will need food assistance because of crop failures and higher food prices.</p>
<p>Dry weather can significantly reduce the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-coffee-c"" id=""5fc346703ca12"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8832"">coffee</a></span> output in No. 2 robusta producer Brazil and No. 3 producer Indonesia. The drought over Espirito Santo, Brazils leading robusta growing state, may cause a reduction in robusta output to 10.85 million 60-kg bags in 2015/16, from 13.04 million last year, according to Brazils Agriculture Ministry mid-November estimate. The Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters and Industries estimate at the same time indicated production could drop to 5.8-6 million 60-kg bags in 2016 from 6.7 million in 2015, depending on the severity of El Nino. Experts mention the impact on coffee prices can be mitigated though as a big harvest from Vietnam may balance the shortage of crops from Brazil.</p>
<p>Recent two El Ninos, the first of which happened between September 2006 and beginning of 2007, and the second started in June 2009 and peaked in January-February 2010, caused a significant rise in prices of grain crops, as can be seen from the Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4 below. Figures 1 and 2 depict the weekly price chart of a composite instrument created on the NetTradeX platform. The instrument is set as a basket of agricultural commodities made up of roughly equal parts (in dollar value) of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc346703cad2"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">corn</a></span>, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/oats"" id=""5fc346703cb82"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""959199"">oats</a></span>, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc346703cc35"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybean</a></span> and wheat.

<p>As is evident from the charts above, the prices of wheat, corn, soybean and oats increased considerably in the one year period after El Ninos of 2006/07 and 2009/10, registering price gains in the range of 26%-98% after the El Nino of 2006/2007. And the prices of four grain commodities rose at least 34% in the one year period after the peak of last El Nino, declining in the first half of the year and advancing in the second half year.</p>
<p>The current El Nino, which is expected to be the biggest in the last 15 years, may potentially have a significant impact on these grain prices. The prices of these four grains are falling since 2012, as can be seen from the weekly candlestick price chart of the composite instrument in the Figure 5.</p>

<p>A reversal of the current bearish trend would require a breakout above the multiyear trend resistance line. While the price is currently rising and both the RSI and MACD indicators are inching up, the price is still below the resistance line and is not clear whether it will test successfully the resistance line and reverse the downtrend yet. And in case of such development the magnitude of any price increases in coming months will be limited by the strength of the US dollar: the US dollar, measured in terms of the ICE <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/us-dollar-index"" id=""5fc346703cce7"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8827"">US Dollar Index</a></span>, has strengthened about 33% since December 2009, and will continue rising as the Federal Reserve is set to start normalizing the interest rates with the first rate hike expected in mid-December.</p>

<p>Much of the recent rally in agriculture commodities, or ags, has been predicated on inclement crop weather and poorer-than-anticipated yields reported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). But now, those trends seem to be turning and prices could unwind on higher supply worries, leaving one less bright spot for commodity bulls.</p>
<p></p><h2 dir=""ltr""><strong>China Politics Complicating The Game Too</strong></h2>
<p>While there are still some genuine concerns for crop prospects, politics are also in play. Speculation has risen in recent days that Beijing will make good on its pledge to buy $50 billion of U.S. agricultural commodities <em>only</em> if the White House cancels new upcoming tariffs on Chinese imports in December  a sign of the continuous twists in the trade war between the two countries.</p>
<p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img title=""Corn Weekly TTM"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic9f56fdb5a8d4a5868db6b946aa62d02f.png"" alt=""Corn Weekly TTM""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Corn Weekly TTM</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p>The three key U.S. ags components fell in Tuesdays trading, though not by too much. Soybeans and wheat lost 0.7% each, while corn fell 1.2%.</p>
<p>Corns losses were larger than the rest. The USDA Crop Production report issued Oct. 10 showed a national corn yield estimate of 168.4, slightly higher than the 168.2 the USDA estimated in September.</p>
<h2><strong> Corn Yields Not Expected To Fall Much</strong></h2><p></p>
<p><strong> </strong>Agweb noted of the USDA report:<strong> </strong></p>
<p></p><blockquote>As farmers across the U.S. rush to save and harvest bushels sitting in the field, USDA isnt budging much on its national estimate for corn yield.</blockquote><p></p>
<p>Seth Meyer of University of Missouris Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute thinks it will be tough to see the USDA make a dramatic revision to the national corn yield, largely due to the time of the year. He says: </p>
<p></p><blockquote>Its possible, but its unlikely at this point. Historically, those yields start to really narrow down by the October estimate. And yes, we can talk about the crop is behind, a little bit less mature, but there still isnt a strong relationship over time. You shouldnt expect large yield and area changes from this point going forward.</blockquote><p></p>
<p></p><h2><strong> </strong><strong>Bull Fatigue Might Be Setting In For Soy And Wheat Too</strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong>Dan Hueber, a veteran ags analyst who writes the daily Hueber Report out of Lake Charles, Illinois, says bull fatigue may be setting in not only for corn but for the other two ags as well. He notes:</p>
<blockquote>We should keep in mind as well that we have now seen prices steadily advance over the past six weeks  so the legs on these bulls could be getting just a bit weary.<strong> </strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>After all, it is not easy to run uphill, even when you have tailwinds generated by winter temperatures and encouraging trade negotiations.<strong> </strong></blockquote>
<p>Hueber said a generally clear weather forecast this week has also eased worries about recent inclement weather in the Northern Plains and frosty temperatures that blanketed a wide swath of the upper Midwest. Plantings were, meanwhile, going on well in competing countries. <strong> </strong></p>
<p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img title=""Soybeans Weekly TTM"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pica09bac5b96c9fb2803de535ab0dc9a9a.png"" alt=""Soybeans Weekly TTM""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Soybeans Weekly TTM</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p>Rains have arrived in South America, with AgRural estimating Brazilian soybean planting being 11% complete, though still behind last years 20% pace. <strong> </strong>Further south in Argentina, farmers were focusing on corn, and it is estimated that they have 24% planted, 2.7% behind last year.  The dry conditions may not be providing the best start, though, and the preliminary rating report stated that just 31.5% of the crop is good, 56% fair, and 12.5% poor. <strong> </strong></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><strong>China Says It Will Buy Based On Demand, Not Pledge To The U.S.</strong><strong> </strong></h2><p></p>
<p>Last but not least is the China story.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Chinese Agriculture Minister Geng Shuang said the countrys ags buying would be dependent on demand and not necessarily the $50 billion tag with which to satisfy U.S. demands. Minister Geng pointed out that for this year alone, China had already purchased 20 million metric tonne of soybeans, 700,000 metric tonnes of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/lean-hogs"" id=""5fc3489968818"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8913"">pork</a></span>, 320,000 metric tonnes of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-cotton-no.2"" id=""5fc34899688bc"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8851"">cotton</a></span> and 700,000 million metric tonnes of sorghum.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>The ministers words were an ominous warning to grains markets veterans like Hueber who noted that even during the peak of the commodity bubble, when soybeans were north of $17 a bushel and corn was above $6 a bushel, Chinas combined annual buying of the two from the U.S. was only around $27 billion.

Then, as gold took off thanks to the firepower of the stimulus unleashed by the Federal Reserve and other global central banks, silver latched on for the ride.</p><p dir=""ltr"">People were originally playing gold for safety, and gold and the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/us-dollar-index"" id=""5fc3446f6ab40"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8827"">dollar</a></span> were trading together, said Streible.</p><blockquote>

<p dir=""ltr"">On the industrial side of things, one part of silver creates seven kinds of industries, from power generation to mining, trucking, metal refining, storage, product making and retailing.&nbsp; And if Vice President Biden gets to the White House, he wants to do this kind of Euro-style vehicle emissions, and wants to fight climate change with lots of solar power, wind power, all types of things that require silver.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote><h2 dir=""ltr"">Wont Blink An Eye If Silver Gets To $50</h2><p dir=""ltr"">A realistic, inflation-adjusted price for silver would be $30 an ounce, Streible said.&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr"">I wouldnt be surprised if (silver) finished the year at $30, he said, after the price hit an eight-year high of $26.28 an ounce this week. I wouldnt even blink an eye if it got to $40 or $50, given its relative undervalue to gold.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Streible said the only way that either silver or gold would get sucker-punched was if a safe, working vaccine was delivered to the market tomorrow.</p><p dir=""ltr"">He said:</p><blockquote>
<p dir=""ltr"">That could take silver back to the $16-$18 range.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But youll need more than the vaccine. Youll also need the Fed to unwind its lending programs and thats not going to happen overnight. Even with the Fed on de-stimulus mode, gold will probably go back to around $1,750 to $1,800 for a start. The bears may not get the precious metals meltdown that they want.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote><p dir=""ltr"">Christopher Lewis, an independent metals analyst who blogs at FX Empire, says its just not worth standing before the freight train that is the silver rally:</p><blockquote>
<p dir=""ltr"">Quite frankly, this is a market that you should never consider selling, at least not anytime soon and considering that the Federal Reserve is looking to liquefy the markets going forward, it is a bit difficult to understand how somebody will think shorting silver is a good idea.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">I think at this point the Federal Reserve will continue to add liquidity to the markets, driving down the value of the US dollar. That in turn drives up the value of precious metals and I think that is essentially what we are looking at here.</p>
</blockquote><p dir=""ltr"">Silver bulls got a bit of a scare on Thursday, as the price fell by almost 4%, caught up in a broad push lower across the commodities complex that swept even gold lower, albeit by a modest 0.6%&nbsp;But the downdraft barely lasted one session.&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr"">On Friday, silver was already up by nearly 4% on the day, while gold finally touched the magical $2,000-an-ounce mark for the first time in history. Even then, it has still not kept pace with silver's gains so far this month. Gold has risen by almost 11%, its largest monthly increase since January 2012.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Lewis said:</p><blockquote>
<p dir=""ltr"">Longer-term, I think that the silver markets (will) go much higher, but we may need to cool off a bit in order to attract more value oriented traders. I have no interest in shorting this market, regardless of what it does next. At the very least we need to consolidate a bit before picking up the pace again. Longer-term, silver is going to go much higher.</p>
</blockquote><h2 dir=""ltr"">Declines Bought Up Quickly</h2><p dir=""ltr"">He said any decline in silver was likely to be bought up quickly.</p><p dir=""ltr"">It will probably fall rather hard at one point or another, but ultimately, we should see the buyers takeover. I think looking for dips makes the most sense and I would be especially interested near the $22 level. The $20 level underneath should continue to be very supportive, and if we would somehow get down there it is likely that we could find plenty of buying pressure.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Eli Tesfaye, precious metals strategist at RJO Futures, agrees:</p><blockquote>
<p dir=""ltr"">Any pullback in silver is seen as an opportunity to buy rather than sell, in my view ... Highs are not in yet in my view.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The gold/silver ratio is still below the 10-year average of 85.30. The trend is your friend.</p>
</blockquote><p dir=""ltr"">The gold:silver ratio is calculated by dividing the price of gold by that of silver. On Friday, the ratio was at 1:81, meaning it currently costs 81 ounces of silver to buy one ounce of gold.&nbsp;The ratio hit a record high of nearly 1:127 in mid-March, when gold was at around $1,704 versus silvers 11-year low at $11.65. The measure has, otherwise, averaged 1:56 for decades.</p><p dir=""ltr"">The silver ratio to gold is still way above what it should be, Streible said. It should go back to the average of around 1:60. I expect silver to continue outperforming gold on a relative basis.</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> <em>Barani Krishnan does not own, or hold positions in, the assets he writes about.</em></p>

<p>The June US Rice Outlook estimates a decrease in global rice production and ending stocks, and an increase in US export forecast for 2018/19 season. In global rice market the production was lowered 2.15 million tons to 487.4 million due to a smaller crop forecast for China, the largest rice producing country. However global rice trade in calendar year 2019 remains projected at a record high of 49.5 million tons, and US exports in 2018/19 were upgraded by 2.0 million cwt to 103.0 million cwt. Lower expected global production and higher US exports are bullish for rice price.</p>

<p><br>We expect the bullish momentum will resume after the price breaches above the upper Donchian bound at 11509. A price above that level can be used as an entry point for a pending order to buy. The stop loss can be placed below the lower Donchian bound at 10.452. After placing the pending order, the stop loss is to be moved to the next fractal low, following Parabolic signals. By doing so, we are changing the probable profit/loss ratio to the break-even point. If the price meets the stop loss level (11.509) without reaching the order, we recommend canceling the order: the market sustains internal changes which were not taken into account.</p>

There was no specific news to knock it off its pedestal, but more the view from an increasing number of analysts that its relative expense to platinum could make its cheaper cousin more appealing for use in catalytic converters.</p>
<p>Speculative investors have been trimming their net long positions for the past five weeks as the metal rallied, and they are now at the lowest since the week of October 30, according to the latest data snapshot from CFTC as at March 26.</p>
<p>The metal has tested support at the 100-day moving average of 1,354.53, which held on a closing basis so far, as it has done since August 28 last year.</p>

Speculative investors also turned more bullish as they increased their net long positions in the week to March 26, boosting them to the highest in a year.</p>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc347e58fa1c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">Gold</a></span> has fallen victim to the pickup in risk appetite over the last week caused by the rebound in the China manufacturing sector, as evidenced by the PMI readings. Reduced desire to hold safe-haven assets drove the yellow metal down to the lowest in 3-1/2 weeks yesterday, having once again given up the 1,300 handle.</p>
<p>Investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/goldman-sachs-group"" id=""5fc347e58faca"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""266"">GS</a></span>) remains bullish on gold amid demand from ETFs and central banks. It maintained its 12-month forecast of 1,450 in a recent client note. Meanwhile, the Uzbekistan central bank has said the country will export more gold this year. It forecasts exports of 80 tons this year, matching the total from 2017 after a dip to 70 tons last year.</p>

<h3><strong>Base metals</strong></h3>
<p>The less-gloomy outlook for global growth has given <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/copper"" id=""5fc347e58fc36"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8831"">Copper</a></span> a boost, pushing the metal to the highest in nine months yesterday after posting the biggest quarterly gain since end-2017 in Q1. Speculative accounts were not prepared for the rebound, as net long positions were at the lowest in five weeks, according to the data snapshot from <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-copper-speculative-net-positions-1620"" id=""5fc347e59038f"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1620"">CFTC</a></span> as of March 26.</p>
<p>The supply side is seeing both good and bad news, with labour strikes being avoided at a mine in Chile but those at a Peru mine continuing. The Peru central bank sees the country raising its trade surpluses in 2019 and 2020 as a result of higher <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/copper"" id=""5fc347e58fcdb"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8831"">copper</a></span> prices and a pickup in demand, according to a report at the weekend. Meanwhile, a China trade association sees the nation using 7%-8% more copper in wires and cables this year.</p>
<h3><strong>Energy</strong></h3>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc347e58fd74"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">Crude Oil</a></span> posted the biggest quarterly gain in a decade in Q1 as OPECs determination to trim production to support prices took hold. Despite speculation that an increase in US production would help reduce the supply deficit, a recent report from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) published Friday showed that average US oil production fell for the first time in six months in January to 11.87 billion barrels from 11.96 billion the prior month. During January, West Texas Intermediate rallied almost 18%, the biggest monthly jump since April 2015.</p>
<p>Speculative investors remain bullish on oil prices, with net non-commercial long futures positions at the highest since the week of February 12, according to the March 26 snapshot from <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-crude-oil-speculative-net-positions-1653"" id=""5fc347e590424"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1653"">CFTC</a></span>.

Prices have struggled to gain any traction and have remained below the 55-day moving average (at 2.8351 today) since December 24. The lack of upward momentum comes despite EIA data last week showing another week of drawdowns on stockpiles, adding up to a run of nineteen weeks.</p>
<p>There may be some glimmer of hope after Bloomberg calculations yesterday suggested UK demand would spike to the highest in two weeks as a cold snap hits across the country. Speculative positioning implies lower expectations for further weakness too, as net short positions were trimmed to their lowest since the week of February 12, according to the latest <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-natural-gas-speculative-net-positions-1820"" id=""5fc347e590b0b"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1820"">CFTC</a></span> data.</p>

If those dont come in line with expectations, then double-digit market swings could become the norm. Thinning market participation is already <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/analysis/back-on-the-bronco-saddle-natural-gas-gives-little-direction-200359861"" id=""5fc346f476171"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""pal"" data-articleid=""200359861"">exacerbating volatility</a></span>, causing daily moves of up to 19 percent lately.</p>
<h3><strong>'Cold December' Far From A Certainty</strong></h3>
<p>Scott Shelton, energy futures broker with ICAP in Durham, North Carolina, says the gas markets biggest challenge might be that a cold December is far from a certainty.</p>
<p>Writing in his daily note, Shelton said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anything can happen to Q1 2019 NatGas. I keep thinking about the crude market where prices move 2-3 percent daily for little reason and think that this also probable in NatGas for the time being as the market digests the prospects for December weather and salt storage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first cold season gas draw of 2018/19 resulted in a pull of 134 billion cubic feet (bcf) from underground salt caverns during the week ending November 16, data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed.</p>
<p>That was the earliest triple-digit gas storage decrease for the month of November, according to federal energy data going back to 1994. The huge jump in gas demand that week overwhelmed analysts, who had been expecting a withdrawal of just around 109 bcf.</p>
<h3><strong>Demand Expectations Higher After Recent Draw</strong></h3>
<p>But the additional 25 bcf draw, coming after the so-called Alaskan Ridge weather phenomenon that caused one of the coldest pre-winter weeks in the US Northeastwhich serves as a bastion for gas-powered heatingmay have brought its own pricing problems.</p>
<p>Thats because the EIAs next gas supply-demand reading, due at 10:30 AM ET (15:30 GMT) today and meant for the week ending November 23, is expected to show a pull of just 77 bcf by analysts estimates. While double the demand for gas seen during the same week a year ago, the next data will make up just over half of the previous 134-bcf draw.</p>
<p>Historically, temperatures from last week were lower than those from a year ago and a three-decade average. According to Reuters, there were 160 heating degree days (HDDs) for last week, versus 131 HDDs the same week a year ago and a 30-year average of 128 HDDs for the period. HDDs measure the number of degrees a day's average temperature is below 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18 degrees Celsius). The measure is used to estimate demand to heat homes and businesses.</p>
<p>Yet on a week-to-week basis, weather for the week ended November 23 was milder than that for the November 16 week.</p>
<h3><strong>Mixed Weather, Strong Production</strong></h3>
<p>Dan Myers, gas analyst at Gelber &amp; Associates in Houston, expects last weeks draw from storage to be</p>
<blockquote>
<p>hampered by lower demand over the Thanksgiving weekend, mixed weather, and stronger production.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stronger production has, in fact, been a running theme in gas throughout this year.</p>
<p>The EIA expects production of dry natural gas to average an all-time high 83.2 bcf per day in 2018, and climb further to 89.6 bcf per day next year.</p>
<p>Large volumes of gas, sourced from primary drilling and also obtained in secondary form during drilling for shale crude, have led to record production of the fuel.</p>
<h3><strong>Bottom Line: 'Expect The Unexpected'</strong></h3>
<p>Despite such overwhelming output, storage levels of gas never reached the danger of overfilling, thanks to strong summer heat and, now, early cold that kept air-conditioners and heaters on overdrive.</p>
<p>If last weeks estimated 77-bcf draw comes through, it would leave storage at 3.036 trillion cubic feet (tcf), the lowest for this time of year since 2000. That would also be 18 percent below the same week a year ago and about 20 percent below the five-year average.</p>
<p>But if there are more freezes in the near-term, then triple-digit draws could be the norm rather than exception.</p>
<p>Says ICAPs Shelton:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The bottom line is to expect the unexpected as liquidity is terrible, and any type of flow will have a much larger effect on the market.</p>

<p>The chart above highlights that the September, Dollar Index futures contract fell to a low of 93.33 on July 29, below the September 2018 low of 93.395. With the break below technical support, the downside target is now at the critical resistance level at 88.15.</p>
<p>Price momentum and relative strength indicators on the monthly chart are falling, and historical volatility is rising as monthly trading ranges have expanded. Open interest, the total number of open long and short positions in the Dollar Index futures contract, has been rising since June as the index declined.</p>
<p>Increasing open interest along with falling price is typically a technical validation of a bearish trend in a futures market. The technical signs in the Dollar Index are pointing lower.</p>
<p>Since the dollar is the benchmark pricing mechanism for many commodities, the dollars decline is pushing commodity prices higher.</p><h2><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Metals are watching the greenback</strong></h2><p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc348e500125"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">Gold</a></span> is both a currency and a commodity.

<p>The chart shows that the dollar index fell from a high of 89.71 in early 2009 in the aftermath of the global financial crisis to a low of 72.86 in 2011. Most commodities prices rose to multiyear or all-time highs in 2011 and 2012.</p>
<p>While the path of the Dollar Index is only one factor when it comes to commodity prices, a weak greenback tends to be bullish. We could be on the verge of a substantial rally in the raw materials asset class over the coming months and years.</p>
<p>In 2020, the stimulus levels are far higher than following the financial debacle a dozen years ago. Fasten your seatbelts; commodity prices could be heading a lot higher than most analysts believe possible.</p>

Indeed, agricultural commodities as a group have slumped.</p>
<p>Though Trump's opening salvo is barely remembered nowhe imposed tariffs on washing machines and solar panels in Januaryhis next move, levies in March on <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/aluminum"" id=""5fc3440416472"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""49768"">aluminum</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/steel-rebar"" id=""5fc344041653b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""996702"">steel</a></span> imports from trading partners including China, the EU and Canada, raised the stakes and put the focus squarely on losses to US businesses.</p>
<p>But since April 4, when China, followed in late May by such allies as the EU, Canada and Mexico among others, retaliated with a roster of their own tariffs aimed at US goods, another, less closely watched sector of the US's economy has been pummeled: agricultural commodities.</p>
<p>Among the $50 billion in US goods that China targeted in its first retaliatory round, soybeans were conspicuous.</p>
<p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic79d0039a6622e48ffbfa6333a8345e99.png"" alt=""Soybean Futures Daily"" title=""Soybean Futures Daily""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Soybean Futures Daily</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p>They've fallen 14.36%. And they're not the only US agricultural goods China focused on. The list also includes <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc34404165eb"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">corn</a></span>, fruit, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/sorghum-future"" id=""5fc3440416696"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""998239"">sorghum</a></span>, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc344041784c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">wheat</a></span>, dairy and vegetable products as well as nuts.

<p>Mexico has also taken aim at US agricultural commodities including apples, bourbon and pork, while the European Union imposed levies on American crops including <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/rough-rice"" id=""5fc34404179b7"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""13916"">rice</a></span>, corn, and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/orange-juice"" id=""5fc3440417a60"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8891"">orange juice</a></span>.</p>
<p>Corn has fallen 5.30% since April while soybean oil has fallen 8.28%. Wheat has risen 5.80% since April 4 but is still down 11.25% from an 11-month high of $548.06 on May 28.</p>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/lean-hogs"" id=""5fc3440417afe"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8913"">Lean hogs</a></span> dropped drastically to $51.73 when the early April tariffs were announced, from $67.60 in mid-March.</p>
<p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic2cd76021aac21cb9daa50b5961eaf89a.png"" alt=""Lean Hog 6 Month Chart"" title=""Lean Hog 6 Month Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Lean Hog 6 Month Chart</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p>However, they've recovered to near a ten-month high of almost $81 as the summer season and upcoming Fourth of July holiday have increased demand domestically. Nevertheless, recent tariffs imposed by China and Mexico on pork products could impact the commodity after the summer ends. As well, many of the other already announced tariffs have not yet been implemented. If and when that happens it will weigh even more heavily on agricultural commodity prices.</p>
<h3><strong>Heartland Squarely Hit</strong></h3>
<p>Chinese and European tariffs on the US weren't implemented randomly. In response to Trumps America First agenda, trading partners carefully calculated which goods are manufactured or grown in the key states that delivered Trump's victory. Since many of the president's base are in the US's farming heartland, it's not surprising agricultural commodities have been so severely hit.</p>
<p>According to Moody's, as reported <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/05/13/china-soybean-tariff-hits-iowas-economy-hardest-new-report-says/605977002/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">in USA Today</a>, ""Iowa exported nearly $2 billion in soybeans to China in 2016, making up about 4 percent of the state's economy  the largest exposure of any state in the nation. Iowa runs a close second to Illinois in soybean production but has much more economic exposure to the crop.""</p>
<p>China is the major purchaser of US soybeans, having bought $14 billion worth of the commodity last year, or 62% of American soybean exports. Soybean prices are declining as a direct result of this trade feud, confirmed John Heisdorffer, Iowa soybean grower and president of American Soybean Association. Prices are down almost a dollar and a half per bushel since the end of May C and continue to plummet. That represents a loss of more than $6.0 billion on the 2018 soybean crop in less than a month.</p>
<p>To say that the last few weeks were tough for corn and soybeans producers is a bit of an understatement, agricultural economist Brent Gloy wrote in a research note. He estimates that a 2,700-acre farm would have lost $210,600 in the last month due to price swings in the grains markets.</p>
<p>It doesn't seem as if either Trump or China, the EU, Mexico and even Canada will be backing down any time soon. The damage to all sides may still be minimal. Though parts of the US heartland might be an early casualty, if hostilities ramp up, farmers and small manufacturers could see drastically shrinking revenues or even be forced to shut down. As well, the higher cost of imported raw materials will cause most US consumers to feel the sting of more expensive goods.</p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

<p><strong>PLATINUM</strong> appears set to fall for a third consecutive day today and looks poised to test the four-month lows just above 789.0 struck last month. Speculative investors were net sellers for a sixth straight week to June 11, and net long positions are now at the lowest since the week of February 19.</p>
<p>There could be some supply-side issues ahead as South Africas biggest union for platinum mine workers kicked off wage negotiations with demands for increases of up to 48%. South Africa is the worlds top supplier of platinum and it could face tough times ahead. However, it is worth noting that the previous agreement settled with 12.5% increases following a starting salvo of 47%.</p>
<p><strong>PALLADIUM</strong> was back in favour with the markets last week, recording the biggest weekly gain in more than two decades. The precious metal is now hovering near 2-1/2 month highs as it climbs from the May lows, which retraced more than 38.2% of the rally from August 2018 to March 2019.</p>
<p>Speculative investors remain bullish on the commodity, increasing net long positions for a fourth straight week and boosting them to the highest since the week of April 2, the latest data from CFTC as at June 11 shows.</p>

Copper stocks in warehouses tracked by the London Metal Exchange are currently at the highest levels since August following a huge increase in stocks on Thursday and Friday last week.</p>
<p>Speculative investors increased net short positions for the seventh week and are now at their most bearish in three years, according to the latest data snapshot as at June 11 from CFTC.</p>

<p><strong>CRUDE OIL</strong> prices spiked higher last week following the attacks on two oil tankers in the Persian Gulf last week. Both the US and Saudi Arabia has blamed Iran for the attacks. Since then, oil prices have drifted lower after the US increased patrols/escort duties to guarantee the safe passage of oil. So far, there appears to be no escalation in tensions observed.</p>
<p>On the supply side, Saudi Arabia is aiming to get agreement on more production cuts at the OPEC meeting in the first week of July. The weekly count of US oil rigs in production showed another slight drop in the week to June 14. The number of rigs in production is now at the lowest since February 2018.</p>
<p>Speculative investors continue to scale back bullish bets on <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc3485209277"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">crude oil</a></span>, being net sellers for a seventh week to June 11, bringing net long position back to the lowest since the week of March 5.</p>

<p><strong>NATURAL GAS</strong> is continuing its gradual drift lower, a theme that has been in place since the start of the year. The commodity appears to be attempting to find support at the lows earlier this month, with investors weighing up the supply-side situation against a possible pickup in demand, with hotter weather in the US Southeast forecast for the June 22-26 period.</p>
<p>On the supply side, data out of China reported by Xinhua News Agency shows Chinas gas output up 12.9% y/y to 14.4 billion cubic meters in May, an acceleration from the 7.9% gain in April.</p>
<h3><strong>Agriculturals</strong></h3>
<p><strong>WHEAT</strong> surged to the highest since August 20 yesterday, following on from the biggest weekly gain in four weeks. The commodity has climbed as much as 32.6% in the past month on supply-side issues as heavy rains delay the start of the planting season in the US.</p>
<p>Speculative accounts have turned bullish on the agricultural commodity as net positioning turned positive after spending 16 weeks with a bearish bias. The last time investors were bullish on wheat was back in February.</p>

<p><strong>CORN</strong> is also suffering under severe wet weather conditions, with the US Midwest unseasonably under water. Prices surged to the highest since 2014 yesterday.

Prices spiked to a near four-month high of 9.154 this morning but have since eased back to 9.018.</p>
<p><strong>SUGAR</strong> is currently retreating from near eight-week highs of 0.1270 touched earlier this morning and is now trading at 0.1261.

<p>Wheat ending stock estimate was lowered in WASDE July report. Will the wheat prices continue rebounding?</p>
<p>Wheat prices are under pressure as harvest gets closer for spring wheat. The US Department of Agriculture revised downward world wheat ending stocks for 2019/20 from previous estimate of 292.43 million metric tons (MMT) to 286.46 MMT in this months World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report. Lower wheat ending stock estimate is bullish for wheat. However, USDA upgraded its US all-wheat production estimates from 1.903 billion bushels in June to 1.921 billion bushels due to an increase in winter wheat attributed to better yields.

<p>On the 4-hour timeframe the <strong>WEHAT: H4</strong> has risen above the 200-period moving average MA(200), this is bullish.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Parabolic indicator</strong> gives a buy signal.</li>
<li>The <strong>Donchian channel </strong>indicates uptrend: it is narrowing up.</li>
<li>The MACD indicator gives a bullish signal: it is above the signal line and the gap is widening.</li>
<li>The RSI oscillator has levelled off and has not reached the oversbought zone yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe the bullish momentum will continue after the price breaches above the upper boundary of Donchian channel at 524.3. This level can be used as an entry point for placing a pending order to buy. The stop loss can be placed below the last fractal low at 502.0. After placing the order, the stop loss is to be moved every day to the next fractal low, following Parabolic signals. Thus, we are changing the expected profit/loss ratio to the breakeven point. If the price meets the stop loss level (502.0) without reaching the order (524.3), we recommend cancelling the order: the market has undergone internal changes which were not taken into account.</p>

<p>I am maintaining my overall oil view and short-term bias at cautiously bearish. The current fundamentals are becoming less supportive as supply and demand may not be as impacted by Iranian sanctions as the market originally estimated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih announced at the weekend that oil supplies from the Kingdom were expected to be about 0.5 million barrels per day (bpd) lower in December.</p>
<p>While the Saudi announcement gave an immediate boost to crude prices, it could still disappoint traders looking for cuts of as much as 1.0 million bpd from OPEC to offset higher supplies resulting from <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/news/commodities-news/factbox-the-knowns-and-unknowns-of-us-iran-oil-sanction-waivers-1677690"" id=""5fc34741d1fa0"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""oal"" data-articleid=""1677690"">generous US waivers</a></span> on Iranian oil sanctions.</p>
<p>Falih chaired a meeting of the so-called Joint OPEC and Non-OPEC Market Monitoring Committee in Abu Dhabi this past weekend. But there were no immediate signs that attendees other than Saudi Arabia, including non-OPEC member Russia, were keen to cut supplies. The Saudi reductions might also be more of a seasonal event, with Falih acknowledging December as a slow period for demand.</p>
<p>While the OPEC group might have missed an opportunity to act, production cuts will most likely top the agenda at the next, more important <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/opec-meeting-230"" id=""5fc34741d1096"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""230"">policy-setting meeting</a></span> on December 6 in Vienna.</p>
<p>OPEC's last round of cuts began in January 2017 when oil prices were emerging from the rut of the 2014-originated US shale glut that drove crude prices down to nearly $25 a barrel. While the reductions were supposed to last until the end of 2018, the group prematurely ended them when prices began rallying sharply from late 2017. This time again, OPECs hand is being forced somewhat by US crude production, now at a weekly record high of 11.6 million bpd.</p>
<h3><strong>Golds $1,200 Support At Risk</strong></h3>

<p>In gold, the $1,200 support that had been the markets bedrock for the past two months could be broken this week after US PPI data on Friday became an endorsement of the Federal Reserve's intention to <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/central-banks/fed-rate-monitor"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""frl"">raise interest rates</a></span> again in December.</p>
<p>The Fed has already hiked rates three times this year and is determined to stay ahead of the inflationary curve with more increases in 2019 after the robust growth seen lately in the US economy. Rate hikes typically boost the dollar, which is a contrarian bet to gold.</p>
<p>The Dollar Index, which measures the greenbacks strength against a basket of six major currencies, shot up 0.22% on Friday, finishing with a fourth straight week of gains. TD Securities said it expected gold to lose more of its safe haven appeal this week and the dollar to become the hedge of choice for investors optimistic about the US economy.</p>
<p>US gold futures for December delivery settled down $16.50, or 1.3%, at $1,208.60 per troy ounce on Friday. That was the sharpest one-day loss in gold futures since August 15. The session bottom was $1,207.30the lowest in four weeks. Analysts at TD Securities said in a note:</p>

1606633618-3445,https://www.investing.com/commodities/us-wheat-opinion/3,"Trade, Fed Minutes And ECB To Help Drive Markets In The Week Ahead",https://www.investing.com/analysis/trade-fed-minutes-and-ecb-to-help-drive-markets-in-the-week-ahead-200470879,"By Marc ChandlerMarket OverviewOct 06, 2019 01:27AM ET","<p><strong>Many high-income countries experienced little growth but strong price pressures in the 1970s. </strong>Since the mainstream economics said the two were mutually exclusive, a new term had to be created, hence stagflation. Fast forward almost half a century later, and mainstream economists are still having a problem deciphering the linkages between prices and economic activity, such as inflation and employment. Theory needs to accommodate the new facts.</p>
<p><strong>Theory is being challenged in another profound way now. </strong>Germany, the world's fourth-largest economy appears to be contracting and experiencing disinflation pressures despite its entire yield curve being below zero. Negative rates have not spurred inflation. It has not bolstered investment. The lower price of money (interest rates) has not spurred demand for it. This is true throughout Europe. Negative rates do not preclude recessions. Nor are they necessarily inflationary as theory might suggest. U.S. and UK inflation is running higher than in the eurozone and Japan, even though the latter have negative interest rates.</p>
<p><strong>Germany, unlike Japan, abhors debt and has, until recentl</strong>y<strong>, not been keen to jettison the ""black zero""</strong> of austerity. Given the debt servicing costs,  many officials still seem to think that they can have their cake and eat it too. Spending can be boosted, and taxes cut without taking on greater debt costs. For its part, Japan, which barely grows in the best of times and barely managed to get <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/national-core-cpi-344"" id=""5fc3488f8b1c3"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""344"">core CPI</a></span> (excludes fresh food) to 1% in recent years to say nothing of the 2% target, just raised the tax on consumption.</p>
<p><strong>At last month's initial tranche of targeted long-term refinancing operations, the ECB practically could not give money away. </strong>There may have been some technical considerations deterring interest, and stronger demand is expected at the next tranche in December. Still, the point remains unmarred that the experiment with negative nominal rates has not generated the kind of economic outcomes that were expected.</p>
<p><strong>While nominal rates are not negative in the U.S., depending on how it is calculated, real interest rates are near or below zero. </strong>The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/rates-bonds/u.s.-10-year-bond-yield"" id=""5fc3488f88f4f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""23705"">10-year</a></span> yield is near 1.53%, and the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/rates-bonds/u.s.-2-year-bond-yield"" id=""5fc3488f89172"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""23701"">2-year</a></span> yield is about 1.4%. The U.S. reports September CPI figures on October 10. The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cpi-69"" id=""5fc3488f8b26e"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""69"">headline rate</a></span> is expected to rise to almost 2%, and the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/core-cpi-56"" id=""5fc3488f8b320"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""56"">core rate</a></span> stable around 2.4%. There are expectations for a of couple market-based measures of inflation. The 10 through 30-year breakevens (the difference between the conventional and inflation-linked yields) are 1.50%-1.60%, and the five-year five-year forward (the expected rate of inflation for five years beginning five years from now) is at 1.90%.</p>
<p><strong>Low and negative interest rates are spurring neither growth nor inflation. </strong>With little real or nominal growth, distributional issues come back to the fore. There are national variations on this theme, but it seems to be a common source of the current political populism. Low real and nominal rates are a function of large economic forces, including weaker population growth, slower productivity growth, past technological advances, and a competitive environment for goods production. </p>
<p><strong>Social organization is important. </strong>Capital launched an offensive in the face of falling profits and stagflation in the 1970s. The governments of the UK and the U.S. purposely weakened unions, the one institution whose raison d'etre was to boost labor's share of the social product. Capital increased its dominance and took an increasingly bigger share. It was too successful. It has so much money, it does not know what to do, so it gives it back to shareholders in the form of buybacks and/or dividends. One CEO of a large internet company claimed to have so much money that he would need to go into space to spend it. Really?  And seriously boosting the compensation of the median employee and/or accepting smaller margins is ideologically unthinkable? </p>
<p><strong>There is a great disparity among companies, but business as a whole in the U.S. is sitting with large savings. </strong>This does not mean corporations do not borrow money. Of course, they do, but they do this on the whole, as part of ""tax minimization"" strategies and other financial considerations. Corporate America is a net creditor. They are a source of capital, not net borrowers. Lenin had it wrong when he said that  ""the capitalists will sell us the rope with which we hang them.""  They apparently are hanging themselves. The biggest threat to capitalism and the ability of the social classes to reproduce those relations is the success of capitalists themselves. They have garnered such a surplus that it drives below zero the return on coupon-clipping (passive ""risk-free"" investment). What Keynes called the ""euthanasia of the rentier class,""  which we seem to be experiencing now, was not at the hands of communists but results of the dynamic of capitalism itself.</p>
<p><strong>II</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Federal Reserve's <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/fomc-meeting-minutes-108"" id=""5fc3488f8b3be"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""108"">minutes</a></span> from the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/analysis/divided-fed-cuts-rates-but-disappoints-stumbles-on-market-mechanics-200465976"" id=""5fc3488f8a74b"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""pal"" data-articleid=""200465976"">September meeting</a></span> that saw three regional presidents dissent from the decision to cut rates 25 bp will be released. </strong>Two did not think a cut was warranted, and one thought a quarter-point move was too small. The record from the ECB's recent meeting that saw several officials speak out against the decision and many link the resignation of Germany's Lautenschlaeger to the disagreement, though no reason has been given, will be reported. The objections to the ECB's actions spurred several former officials from Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, and France to write a <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2019-10-04/memorandum-on-ecb-monetary-policy-by-issing-stark-schlesinger"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">""memorandum""</a> outlining their criticism.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The Federal Reserve may not be as divided as the three dissents, and the dot plot suggests. </strong>First, there have not been dissents from any of the Governors, and Vice-Chairman Clarida's emphasis on reaching the 2% inflation target implies that the Board favors a cut. That is five votes, but the NY Fed President Williams has a permanent vote at the FOMC and will vote with the Governors. Bullard, who is the leading dove, might be persuaded to support a 25 bp cut and close ranks. That leaves the standpat Rosengren and George, who objected to both the July and September cuts.</p>
<p><strong>The weakness in the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/manufacturing-pmi-829"" id=""5fc3488f8b47a"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""829"">PMI</a></span>/<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/ism-manufacturing-pmi-173"" id=""5fc3488f8b527"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""173"">ISM</a></span> reports and the fall in U.S. equities spurred speculation of not one but possibly two Fed <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/central-banks/fed-rate-monitor"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""frl"">rate cuts</a></span> this year; one at the end of this month and one at the last meeting in mid-December. </strong>The 2-year note yield fell more than 20 bp last week. The yield of the January 2020 Fed funds futures contract fell by 12 bp last week to 1.455%. The current average effective rate is around 1.83%-1.85%. The U.S. employment data, however, does not show an economy falling off the cliff as some of the survey data seemed to imply.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/nonfarm-payrolls-227"" id=""5fc3488f8b5d6"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""227"">Job growth</a></span> slowed, but it was still sufficient to see the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/unemployment-rate-300"" id=""5fc3488f8b674"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""300"">unemployment rate</a></span> fall to 3.5%, its lowest level since the end of 1969, and that was with a steady <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/participation-rate-1581"" id=""5fc3488f8b717"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1581"">participation rate</a></span> (63.2%). </strong>The underemployment rate also fell to a new cyclical low (6.9% vs. 7.2%). Back-month revisions are understood by some economists as an indication of the underlying trend, and the 45k upward revisions help offset the somewhat lower than expected nonfarm payroll gain in September.</p>
<p><strong>The main disappointment, however, was with the flat <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/average-hourly-earnings-8"" id=""5fc3488f8b7ad"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""8"">average hourly earnings</a></span>, which saw the year-over-year increase slip to 2.9% from 3.2%. </strong>It is the lowest since last July. The UAW strike at General Motors (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/gen-motors"" id=""5fc3488f89228"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""239"">GM</a></span>) might have impacted earnings even if the jobs survey was conducted before the strike began in a statistical quirk. Next month's nonfarm payroll report will pick up the strike at GM, provided if it lasts through the end of next week, which at this juncture looks likely.</p>
<p><strong>Based on this week's developments, we see no reason to alter our base case that the Fed stands pat at the FOMC meeting at the end of this month. </strong>We expect the Fed to focus on the plumbing and favor a permanent repo facility as the most likely way to boost repo liquidity rather than increasing reserves (organically or through QE) and hoping that the banks will repo the excess reserves. The Federal Reserve is likely to reserve QE for the conduct of monetary policy. It needs to help investors keep separate the plumbing issues (maturity transformations) from the decision about the price and quantity of money. After standing pat in October, we look for a cut at the December 11 meeting for largely the same reasons as the first two cuts in H2 19: below target inflation presents a low-cost opportunity to help extend the expansion.</p>
<p><strong>The ECB is not nearly as fragmented as it sounds either, but the fissure there may be more profound. </strong>Many of the differences between the Fed and ECB seem superficial, but one important distinction is in the structure. When fully staffed, the Board of Governors at the Fed have a majority of votes at the FOMC. There are two vacant seats presently. There are more regional presidents, but four rotate and the NY Fed president, as we noted before has a permanent vote. The Federal Reserve was designed to give the Governors control. The ECB has a relatively small board, and a larger number of the <em>regional presidents </em>vote even though a rotating system has been introduced.</p>
<p><strong>Of the seven former officials that signed or endorsed the memo cited above, only two came from the ECB's executive board, the other five were from national central banks</strong>. The two former Board members and one former president of a central bank, which means three of the seven, came from Germany. Lautsenshlaeger, who recently resigned, was not one of the endorsers.</p>
<p><strong>The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/analysis/ecb-resignation-exposes-eurozones-growing-northsouth-rift-200469756"" id=""5fc3488f8b0a0"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""pal"" data-articleid=""200469756"">main divide</a></span> is between creditors and debtors. </strong>Germany, the Netherlands, Austria objected to asset purchases from the get-go. Estonia also objected though none of its officials were included in the memo. France's official objection last month seemed to stem from the timing, unlike the others who opposed on principle. Like the distribution problem discussed above, the tension between creditor and debtor interests can be ameliorated by stronger growth, and some would argue, more federalism (e.g., Draghi endorsing a fiscal union). The new ECB president may seek procedural solutions to the division, such as developing the ECB record to allow individual arguments to be expressed and identified, which Draghi resisted. However, the underlying challenge is that the creditors are a minority in Europe.</p>
<p><strong>On substantive grounds, the survey and real sector data continue to weaken while the lending data and money supply growth are firm. </strong>Germany's August <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/german-factory-orders-130"" id=""5fc3488f8bc12"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""130"">factory orders</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/german-industrial-production-135"" id=""5fc3488f8bcbe"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""135"">industrial production</a></span> reports are the highlights in the week ahead. Factory orders plunged 2.7%  in July, which offset in full the rise in June. Orders are expected to have fallen around 0.4% in August. The average monthly decline through July has been 1.0% compared with a 0.9% average decline in the same 2018 period. The year-over-year contraction is expected to deepen from the -5.6% in July to closer -6.7% in August. The worst so far was recorded in May with an 8.5% year-over-year decline.</p>
<p><strong>Industrial output is weakening. It has fallen in three of the four months through July. </strong>The average monthly decline this year has been 0.5% compared with a 0.2% decline in the first seven months of 2018. The year-over-year contraction reached a 10-year extreme of -4.7% in June. It stood at -4.2% in July and is expected to have remained there in August. There seems little doubt that the German economy more broadly is contracting and that deflationary winds are strengthening, and that was before the escalation of trade tensions with the U.S..</p>
<p><strong>The U.S. tariffs in response to the WTO ruling will be implemented in a couple of weeks. President Trump must make a decision about tariffs on autos by the middle of next month. </strong>These risks, coupled with Brexit, remain potent. UK Prime Minister Johnson continues to publicly reject Parliament's instructions to seek a delay if an agreement is not struck soon. In court, the government has indicated it intends to adhere to its legal orders. A three-month delay seems the most likely scenario, during which time the UK will hold a national election. Survey results warn of what the British like to call a hung parliament, which in most other countries is understood as a coalition government.</p>
<p><strong>China returns from its national holiday that began on October 1. Since it left, the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/us-dollar-index"" id=""5fc3488f892eb"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8827"">dollar</a></span> has fallen by about 0.4% against the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-cnh"" id=""5fc3488f89395"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""961728"">offshore yuan</a></span> (CNH). </strong>The JP Morgan Emerging Markets Currency Index has risen a little more than 1% over the last three sessions. The dollar also eased against many of the major currencies, including the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/eur-usd"" id=""5fc3488f8943e"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""1"">euro</a></span>, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-jpy"" id=""5fc3488f894f4"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""3"">yen</a></span>, and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/gbp-usd"" id=""5fc3488f89593"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""2"">sterling</a></span>. The risk of a non-linear move by the yuan seems minimal. Nor are Chinese shares particularly vulnerable even though the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/msci-ac-asia-pacific"" id=""5fc3488f8963a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""942944"">MSCI Asia Pacific Index</a></span> lost almost 1% last week.

<p><strong>China will report some financial data, including <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/fx-reserves-(usd)-866"" id=""5fc3488f8c1a1"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""866"">reserves</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/new-loans-1060"" id=""5fc3488f8c65c"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1060"">lending</a></span> figures. </strong>Caixin's <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/caixin-services-pmi-596"" id=""5fc3488f8c71d"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""596"">services</a></span> and composite PMI will be reported. The data won't change the general impression that the world's second-largest economy continues to slow. Most of this seems to reflect China's own internal dynamics, but part of it is likely traceable to the disruption of U.S. tariffs, the adjustments being made, and the uncertainty of the situation. China's trade delegation comes to the U.S. next week to hold face-to-face talks with the administration. One metric for the negotiations is whether the U.S. refrains from implementing the duties that were already delayed from Oct.1 to Oct. 15.</p>
<p><strong>We reject assertions that paint China's purchases of U.S. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc3488f89830"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soy</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc3488f898d6"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">wheat</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/lean-hogs"" id=""5fc3488f89974"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8913"">pork</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/live-cattle"" id=""5fc3488f89a10"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8914"">beef</a></span> ahead of the talks as goodwill gestures. </strong>There is a shortage of goodwill and a surplus of national interest. These actions are driven by China's needs. The fact that they may placate the mercurial American president is an added benefit. The market has responded to heightened trade tensions as a deflationary force and weighs on equities and yields, and often the dollar appears to trade heavier. President Trump's public request that China investigate the Bidens is likely to reinforce Beijing's cautiousness in dealing with Washington and, like when Trump recently claimed Chinese officials called and wanted to resume trade talks, it seems provocative at this level of politics. Imagine what we would think about a foreign leader who did that to us. The U.S. also revealed that a trade agreement, if even struck, would not prevent it from confronting China elsewhere, like on portfolio flows, arming Taiwan, and the South China Sea. We suspect that the Trump Administration wants a trade deal now more than China.</p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc3482ab673e"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">Corn</a></span> prices climbed to the highest since June 2016 today amid reports that U.S. producers are delaying corn planting following a record wet spell across the country, with more rainy weather forecast to come. Todays advance marks the 10th daily gain in the past 11 days as the commodity powers upwards from the near eight-month lows hit on May 13. The gains have reached more than 20% from the base.</p>
<p>The sudden U-turn in sentiment has seen speculative accounts turn net long for the first time since the week of Feb. 26, according to the latest data snapshot from CFTC as at May 21.</p>

Speculative investors are also not convinced that a rally is about to begin, as negative bets on the commodity increased to the highest since September last year, the latest data from CFTC shows.</p>
<p>Modis victory in the Indian general election is seen benefiting the sugar industry there, with more government subsidies expected, and this could lead to increased production and subsequently exports.</p>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc3482ab797b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916""> Soybean </a></span> prices have posted the biggest one-day gain in two weeks today and could aim for the highest level this month. Such a move could bring about the first up-month for the commodity in four months. Last week the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced another aid package for American farmers that had been hurt by the U.S.-China tariff war, notably corn, wheat and soybean farmers.</p>
<p>Speculative investors pared back negative bets on the commodity from the highest in more than 20 years in the week to May 21, according to CFTC data.</p>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc3482ab7a40"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">Wheat </a></span> prices have climbed to the highest levels since February 19 this morning, trading above the 200-day moving average at 4.855 for the first time since Feb. 15. The boost comes amid supply-side concerns with reports circulating that the China harvests may be affected by heavy rainfall along the Yangtze and Han rivers.</p>
<p>The commodity is poised for the biggest monthly gain in two years, and this has pressured speculative investors to trim net short positions for a third consecutive week. They now stand at the lowest since the week of February 12, according to the latest data from CFTC as at May 21.</p>

The deterioration in sentiment surrounding the U.S.-China trade negotiations has given gold a lift as a safe haven asset.</p>
<p>Speculative investors trimmed net long positions for the first time in four weeks, the latest CFTC data shows, despite concerns about the global growth trajectory. News of an earthquake in Northern Peru close to a number of gold and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/copper"" id=""5fc3482ab7b7a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8831"">copper</a></span> mines had little impact.</p>

Silver is flat on the week, but the gold/silver (Mint) ratio is set for a fourth monthly gain after touching the highest in more than a decade earlier in the month. Speculative investors remain bearish on the commodity, and they increased their net short positions for the third week in a row, CFTC data shows. Short bets are now at the highest since November last year.</p>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/platinum"" id=""5fc3482ab7d98"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8910"">Platinum </a></span> looks set for the third straight daily gain today but is still facing the biggest monthly drop since September 2017. Gloomy car sales globally continue to raise concerns about future demand for platinum. Speculative investors continue to bail out of stale long positions what had chased the commodity to one-year highs last month. Net long positions are now at the lowest since the week of February 19.</p>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/palladium"" id=""5fc3482ab7e49"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8883"">Palladium</a></span> looks poised for a second monthly drop in three months as it extends the recent decline from record highs above 1,600 in March. Yesterday, the 55-day moving average at 1,410.80 traded below the 100-day moving average at 1,412.43 for the first time since October 5. This is generally viewed as a medium-term bearish signal. Speculative investors might like to disagree however, as they increased their net long positions for the first time in three weeks, according to the latest report as at May 21 from CFTC.</p>

The industrial metal is attempting a rebound this week, even though President Trump said yesterday he was not yet ready to do a deal with China. If the metal can maintain this weeks upward momentum, it would be the first weekly gain in seven weeks.</p>
<p>On the mining front, companies reported no noticeable damage to mines from the Peru earthquake, while wage negotiations at mines in Chile are entering possibly the final stages. The latest offer has been presented to the unions, which would be valid for 27 months. A first offer was rejected and the latest one has a deadline of this Friday.</p>
<p><strong>Energy</strong></p>

Bloomberg reported that a number of agencies, including the Energy Information Agency, have cut their oil demand forecasts by 9%-13% in the past 12 months. The report highlights that OPECs own forecast is the most conservative at 1.2 million barrels per day.</p>
<p>This could imply that the current production cuts may be with us for a while. Also on the supply side, the number of US oil rigs in production fell below the 800 mark for the first time since March 2018, weekly data from Baker Hughes has shown.</p>
<p>WTI has managed to hold above the 100-day moving average, now at $58.27, on a closing basis since February 26. It is trading at $58.97 today.</p>

Oats Futures Rally Anyhow,https://www.investing.com/analysis/trade-war-or-european-drought-oat-rallies-anyhow-200336845,"By Investing.com (Barani Krishnan/Investing.com)CommoditiesAug 07, 2018 02:49AM ET","<p dir=""ltr""><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/oats"" id=""5fc3441686b45"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""959199"">Oat</a></span> lovers may have nervously downed their favorite breakfast the past week after seeing US futures of the grain rocket without much explanation. The good news for them is that the market action in Chicago is unlikely to change the boxed price of the cereal anytime soon C or might not all, if history is a guide.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">A week into August, oats futures on the Chicago Board of Trade are up 12 percent on the month, with more than half of those gains C 6.7 percent precisely C coming from Mondays trade alone. The market has risen in eight of the past nine sessions, topping the daily performance chart of 60 commodity and global macro futures tracked by Barchart since Friday.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Reasons cited by analysts range from worries about the drought affecting both the quality and volume of European-grown oat to speculation that the US-China trade war could prompt Beijing to begin buying oat from top producer Canada to avoid paying tariffs on American feed grains.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic2b27b3316e3894f15f4ca90384399369.jpeg"" alt=""Oat Daily Chart"" title=""Oat Daily Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Oat Daily Chart</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Mondays peak of $2.6690 per bushel on the CBOT placed oat near 5-month highs and on track to a 11 percent gain for 2018 after a rally that has persisted since April, with the exception of last month. While nowhere near the 34 percent gain posted by CBOT <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc3441686dea"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">wheat</a></span> on the year, oat has outperformed the two other major US grains markets C <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc3441686eaa"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">corn</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc3441686f67"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soy</a></span>, which are up 6 percent and down 8 percent, respectively.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">And the upward trajectory may not be over yet, with Investing.coms daily technicals still calling for a Strong Buy and citing stiff Fibonacci-based resistance only from $2.75 per bushel onward C about 8 cents above Mondays settlement. Some analysts have a higher target of $3 per bushel.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Current Rally Purely Driven By Speculation?</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Other than being a nice, round number, theres nothing really fundamental or technical to support that $3 forecast, said Shawn Hackett at Hackett Financial Advisors, a grains analysis service in Boca Raton, Florida. It tells you of the sheer speculation thats driving this market, and I think its all to do with China possibly looking at Canadian oats to circumvent their US feed imports.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But Hackett also thinks Beijings stringent <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-rice-idUSKBN1A523V"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Photosanitary Protocol</a> for grain imports will end up hampering the entry of Canadian oats, resulting in the CBOT rally eventually running out of steam. With <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/rough-rice"" id=""5fc344168700a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""13916"">rice</a></span>, for example, China opened for imports in 2001 but only started taking US product last year after the two agreed on the protocol.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Impressive as oats milestones and prices are now, the market remains one of the smallest components of the US agricultural complex, with just about 25 million bushels trading on the CBOT compared with the more than 9 billion bushels of open interest in corn.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The less liquid conditions for trading oat versus major grains means that it takes just a handful of speculators sometimes to create a big move up or down in the cereals futures.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Futures Moves Have Little Impact On Real Prices</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Spikes and tumbles in CBOT oat seldom, if ever, filter through to the physical market, which determines what leading oats brands such as PepsiCo (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/pepsico"" id=""5fc34416870bc"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8358"">PEP</a></span>)s Quaker, B&amp;G Foods (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/b-g-foods-holdings-corp"" id=""5fc344168716f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""20521"">BGS</a></span>) McCann's and Trader Joes pay for the raw material. With the US oat production barely covering domestic demand and the country not shipping any for exports, international physical prices vary by origin of the grain C whether they are Canadian, Australian, German, Finnish or Swedish C and by grading that separates oats for human consumption from that for animal feed.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">A number of the people who deal in the physical product dont even use the futures because of its exaggerated volatility, said Chuck Penner, an analyst who specializes in Canadian crops for Winnipeg-based Leftfield Commodity Research.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The physical average price for oat is around $2 per bushel now, and thats a 70-cent discount from the futures, Penner said. Even if you move the futures up to $3, it wouldnt make a material impact on a bag of oatmeal.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While he agrees with Hackett that the current futures rally is almost entirely speculative, he thinks the buying is being driven by worries about how crops were wilting to extreme heat in Europe, rather than Canadas potential to export oat to China.</p>

Year-to-date the S&amp;P 500 is down only 1.11%, although it's still 8.79% below the April 29th interim high. There are now six trading days left in 2011.

<p dir=""ltr"">Trump warned last Friday that nearly $500 billion in additional Chinese goods could come under US tariffs soon, narrowing Beijings chance of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/news/economy-news/trump-shows-hes-ready-to-go-allin-against-china-on-tariffs-1602712"" id=""5fc3473506411"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""oal"" data-articleid=""1602712"">escaping the bilateral trade conflict</a></span> without significant damage. Washington will act on $200 billion of tariffs very soon depending on what happens, Trump told reporters on the Air Force One presidential jet. I hate to do this, but behind that, there is another $267 billion ready to go on short notice if I want.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">His caution would be chilling particularly to investors in copper, as the <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-copper/what-dr-copper-ordered-trade-war-gives-china-metal-a-shot-in-the-arm-idUSKCN1L712G"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">metal in scrap form</a> is one of the biggest industrial commodities China buys from the US.</p>

<h3>Bearish Mood In Copper And Gold</h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">Considering the ebbs and flows of trade angst, which continue to bolster the mighty dollar and add pressure to copper prices, we suspect that traders will likely continue to shun the red metal's firm fundamentals for now, TD Securities said in a pre-weekend note.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">US copper for December delivery settled down 2.4 percent last week at $2.6225 per lb, garnering a Strong Sell recommendation on Investing,coms daily <a href=""/commodities/copper-technical"">technical</a> outlook. Based on the strong Level 3 Fibonacci support of $2.6110, the contract might have to lose at least 1 percent more to attract a buy rating.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">And while bullion appears to have established a floor at the $1,200 per ounce level, Investing.coms <a href=""/commodities/gold-technical"">technicals</a> are Neutral on US gold for December, suggesting a buy if it returns to the 20-day moving average of $1,195.44.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Some say gold needs to drop further.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">I still believe that we will retest the August 16th low of $1,167 in the coming days ahead as the U.S economy is strong, said Mike Seery of Seery Futures in Plainfield, Illinois.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Seery cited the US economys addition of 201,000 US jobs last month and the Treasurys <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/rates-bonds/u.s.-10-year-bond-yield"" id=""5fc34734dd06d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""23705"">10-year</a></span> note yield of 2.94 percent as signs that the Federal Reserve will <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/central-banks/fed-rate-monitor"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""frl"">hike rates</a></span> again, boosting the dollar. I see no reason to own gold for now, he said in summation.</p>
<h3>More Downside For US Crude</h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">In oil, traders and investors will be on the lookout for supply-demand reports from the triumvirate of oil agencies C the Energy Information Administration (EIA) of the US, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in Vienna and the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA).</p>
<p dir=""ltr""></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picdcea6283fce3e6c7e49f287f2286d2f7.jpeg"" alt=""WTI Daily Chart"" title=""WTI Daily Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">WTI Daily Chart</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">First will be the EIA's short-term energy outlook on Tuesday, particularly on oil price expectations. In its last short-term report for August, the EIA said it expects the monthly average of UK <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/brent-oil"" id=""5fc34734dd114"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8833"">Brent oil</a></span> to remain at $70 to $73 per barrel from August 2018 through 2019. Brent settled on Friday at $77.03.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Next up will be OPEC's report on Wednesday. Last month, OPEC revised down its 2019 world oil demand growth forecasts by 20,000 barrels per day to 1.43 million bpd due to weaker-than-expected demand from Latin America and the Middle East. At the same time, it revised up world supply growth forecasts, indicating an upward revision of 106,000 bpd to 61.75 million bpd in non-OPEC oil supply in 2019.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Also on Wednesday, the EIA will release its <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/eia-weekly-distillates-stocks-917"" id=""5fc34735059b1"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""917"">weekly oil storage</a></span> report. While the last EIA weekly report had a US crude drawdown of 4.3 million barrels that was twice more than expected, an <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/supply/weekly/pdf/highlights.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">unexpected hike in total US oil products</a> overwhelmed that figure.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Last in the series will be the IEA monthly report on Thursday. In its August supply, the Paris-based agency noted a material slowdown in global oil demand growth in the second and third quarters. It has predicted a rebound in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Analysts expect the net effect of these reports to be positive for Brent versus US West Texas Intermediate crude.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This shift could lead to a wider Brent-WTI spread in 2019 than the $6/bbl we are currently projecting, energy analysts at Bank of America said in a report.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">With last Fridays settlement of $67.75 per barrel for WTI, the difference between the two is already at around $10 in Brents favor.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Investing.coms daily <a href=""/commodities/crude-oil-technical"">technical</a> outlook also has a Strong Sell on WTI, with Woodies Level 3 support only emerging at $65.92.</p>

<p>First was the focus on the junk bonds (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/etfs/spdr-barclays-high-yield-bond"" id=""5fc348f81c65b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""40651"">JNK</a></span>) and&nbsp;investment grade bonds (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/etfs/ishares-inv-g-bond"" id=""5fc348f81c899"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""40648"">LQD</a></span>).</p>
<p>Junk bonds have remained strong indicating the appetite for high risk companies has not waned-good, news for the market.</p>
<p>LQD or investment grade bonds sold off into a warning phase. However, on a weekly chart, it held just where it needed to at 134.54-the area of support for now.</p>
<p>Second was the focus on the banking and financial sectors of the market.</p>
<p>Although those sectors saw a brief pop, XLF (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/etfs/financial-select-sector-spdr-fund"" id=""5fc348f81c950"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""40668"">XLF</a></span>) and KRE (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/etfs/spdr-kbw-regional-banking"" id=""5fc348f81c9ff"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""38281"">KRE</a></span>) are pretty much exactly at the prices they were when I left.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>Most likely, these areas reflect the reality of the economy and how many loan defaults and bankruptcies continue to plague real economic growth.</p>
<p>Third was the dollar, low rates, rising metals, up move in sugar and all the factors that still support a stagflation theory.</p>
<p>Is that still in play?</p>
<p>No doubt the recent rally to new highs in the S&amp;P 500 (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/etfs/spdr-s-p-500"" id=""5fc348f81caba"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""525"">SPY</a></span>) and Nasdaq (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/etfs/powershares-qqqq"" id=""5fc348f81cb70"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""651"">QQQ</a></span>) is impressive.</p>

<p>Here is where we see the stagnation part of the stagflation theory.</p>
<p>To date, grains (<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc348f81cf7c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">wheat</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc348f81d02a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span>), which I have pointed out repeatedly as trading at 100-year lows versus the SPY, have rallied well.</p>

Above both the 50 and 200-DMAs, provided cash holds above 12.25, sugar can continue to tell us more about rising food costs amid supply chain disruptions.</p>

<p><strong>CRUDE OIL</strong> prices have fallen for the past three days despite rumours circulating that OPEC and its allies are planning to cut supply further at its December meeting. Russia has stated it is too early to commit to deeper production cuts ahead of the December 5-6 gathering in Vienna. Last week, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) posted the biggest weekly gain in five weeks to test the 55-week moving average at $56.72, which held at this attempt.</p>
<p>The number of U.S. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/u.s.-baker-hughes-oil-rig-count-1652"" id=""5fc348a74044f"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1652"">oil rigs</a></span> in production fell for the first time in two weeks and is now at the lowest since April 2017. Saudi Arabia announced that the Aramco IPO will go ahead on Dec. 4, with trading starting on Dec. 11. Speculative investors were net buyers of the commodity for a second consecutive week, according to the latest data snapshot from CFTC as at October 22.</p>

Speculative investors increased net short positions for a third straight week, raising them to the most since the week of August 13.</p>
<h2><strong>Precious Metals</strong></h2><p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc348a73fd1c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">GOLD</a></span></strong> has taken a back seat when it comes to demand as the hopes for a breakthrough in the U.S.-China trade negotiations breathe life into risk appetite and reduce the need for safe haven assets. The precious metal has retreated from near four-week highs as demand waned, and failed to close above the 55-day moving average at 1,504 this time around.</p>
<p>Demand is also slowing from the Indian retail sector as last Friday, the traditional, most auspicious day for buying gold in India, passed with sales reportedly down about 20% from a year earlier. High prices and a slowing economy have been blamed for the weak demand.</p>
<p>Speculative investors remain bullish however, increasing net long positions for a third straight week in the week to October 22, CFTC data show. The buying pulled net long positioning from three-month lows.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/silver"" id=""5fc348a73fdd3"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8836"">SILVER</a></span></strong> is also under pressure, facing the biggest weekly loss in more than a month, despite the prospects of a Fed rate cut later today and possible pickup in demand if the U.S.-China Phase 1 trade deal is signed. Speculative accounts were net buyers at the last reporting date, lifting net long positioning from an 11 week low. The gold/silver (Mint ratio) has been steady near one-month lows this week.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/palladium"" id=""5fc348a73fe84"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8883"">PALLADIUM</a></span></strong> reached a new record high above 1,800 on Monday and has consolidated those gains since. There is a perceived increase in demand for the vital metal used in automobile emissions control units amid more stringent environmental regulations in Europe and China. Speculative investors have had a good run on long positions and some have taken the latest gains as an opportunity to book some profits. Accounts were net sellers for a second consecutive week in the week to October 22, according to the latest data from CFTC.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/platinum"" id=""5fc348a73ff40"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8910"">PLATINUM</a></span></strong> gains have been limited in comparison and peaked at the end of last week. Last weeks gains were the most since the end of August, but the metal has slid 0.65% so far this week. Speculative investors remain bullish on the metal, having boosted net long positions to the highest since February last year.</p>
<p></p><h2><strong>Base Metals</strong></h2><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/copper"" id=""5fc348a73fff9"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8831"">COPPER</a></span></strong> prices reached the highest in six weeks yesterday amid hopes that a mini U.S.-China trade deal will stir up increased demand for the industrial metal. In addition, supply concerns were heightened after workers at Chiles ports decided to stop work for two days starting yesterday in a strike protest. Union members also staged three days of stoppages last week.Speculative investors mounted the bull bandwagon in the latest reporting week to October 22, turning net buyers for a second straight week, according to CFTC data. Stocks of copper at warehouses monitored by the London Metal Exchange (LME) as at Monday were the lowest since April.<h2><strong>Agriculturals</strong></h2><p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc348a7400a3"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">SOYBEANS</a></span></strong> look set to fall for a second week after hitting the highest since June 2018 on October 22. Soybeans have fallen 2.5% from that peak but today are facing the first up-day in four days. The 55-day moving average at 8.855 as acting as the next technical support point and prices have traded above that moving average since September 12.</p>
<p>China has said that the terms of the Phase 1 agreement are basically complete, suggesting that the deal will be ready for signing by the two leaders at the APEC summit in Chile next month. The U.S. has stated that inspections of soybeans ready for export are up 18% from a week earlier to 1.57 million tons, with about a third heading to China, according to Bloomberg reports.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc348a74015c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">WHEAT</a></span></strong> fell last week for the first time in eight weeks after reaching the highest since June on the back of Chinas agreement to buy more U.S. agricultural products as part of the Phase 1 deal. The rally stalled near the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the June-September drop at 5.285.</p>
<p>A recent Bloomberg survey showed U.S. wheat growers are set to plant the least number of acres of wheat in 110 years during this season. Weak prices and better returns for planting corn have been cited for the drop. Speculative investors have increased net long positions to the most since the week of July 30.</p><div class=""outerEleWrapper"">

The 55-week moving average support was tested earlier this week while the 100-day moving average resistance has been in place since August 12.</p>
<p>An uptick in corn feed demand is possible as Chinas pork industry recovers from the bout of swine fever that swept through the industry. This could coincide with smaller corn harvests domestically due to unfavourable weather conditions and lend support to corn prices.</p>
<p>Speculative investors turned net sellers for the first time in four weeks.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-sugar-no11"" id=""5fc348a7402ac"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8869"">SUGAR</a></span></strong> has been consolidating between the 55- and 200-day moving averages at 0.1142 and 0.1205 respectively since late-September. Upside momentum has stalled for the moment, but the threat of a supply shortfall during the current season should keep prices supported.</p>
<p>Speculative accounts remain skeptical, having increased net short positions to the highest since records began back in 1983.</p>

In true political fashion, we will likely see a can being kicked down the road by trade negotiators, and that will be enough for a recovery rally.</p>

<p><b>Treasuries don't seem to believe there will be ""no deal"".</b></p>
<p>We have to believe if bond traders expected a complete political failure in the talks between the US and China we would be seeing much more motivated buying. That said, there was a <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/rates-bonds/u.s.-10-year-bond-yield"" id=""5fc3480a5c7d8"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""23705"">10-year note</a></span> auction yesterday that was a huge disappointment and there is some concern that one of the largest buyers of US debt (China) is closing its wallet.</p>
<p>We haven't had a strong opinion in Treasuries for weeks, but we would love to have an opportunity to get bearish the ZB in the mid-150 to 151'0 area.</p>

<p>Brokerages are increasing overnight day trading rates in response to what could be a wild night in the equity futures markets. It kind of feels like election night 2016, but we doubt the volatility will come anywhere close to that. If it does, traders could be in store for a long night.</p>
<p>We admit the market isn't cheap, but ""sell in May and go away"" hasn't worked well in recent years. The real selling has been coming later in the summer. With that in mind, and the fact that the market failed to reach trendline resistance (3,030), or even the psychological 3,000 area, we think there is one more leg left on the bull. If this is the case, the 2840ish will need to hold (keep in mind, a quick probe to 2820s isn't a deal breaker if the market recovers).</p>
<p><b>Stock index futures market consensus:</b></p>
<p>We aren't sure the highs are in, but there is no reason to be aggressively bullish. The best trades will likely be from the short side at higher levels. In the meantime, look for support near 2840 to hold.</p>

<li>Wheat moves to a six-year high</li>
<li>Elevated grains prices translate to higher meat prices</li>
<li>Mother Nature could throw commodities a curveball in 2021</li>
</ul><p>On Friday, Oct. 9, the US Department of Agriculture released its monthly World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report. Producers and consumers consider the USDAs report as the gold standard for agricultural products. Many make business and hedging decisions based on it.</p>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34910d672c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">Soybean</a></span>, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc34910d6975"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">corn</a></span>, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc34910d6a2a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">wheat</a></span> and animal protein prices had already been appreciating over the past weeks and months. The latest WASDE report supported recent gains.</p>
<p>The WASDE spells out changes in crop yields, stockpiles, imports and exports, and consumer demand in the volatile agricultural sector. The weather conditions in the leading growing areas determine supplies each year and can be extremely variable.</p>
<p>A derecho in mid-August weighed on supplies and caused prices to rise. Meanwhile, the demand side of the fundamental equation is ever-increasing. According to the US Census Bureau, each quarter the world adds approximately twenty million people. At the turn of this century, six billion people inhabited the earth. At the end of last week, that number was over 28% higher at 7.69 billion. Each day there are more mouths to feed, meaning that the world must produce more of the agricultural products required for nutrition.</p>
<p>Since 2012, plentiful crops of grains and other agricultural commodities have been sufficient to meet requirements. Because the world will require more products in 2021 than in 2020, and the weather will determine production, we could see lots of price variance and higher prices in agricultural futures markets in the coming months and years. Time will tell if the rally that began over the past months is the start of the significant bullish trend in agricultural commodity prices.</p><h2><strong>Soybeans rise above a level of technical resistance</strong></h2><p>As the 2020 harvest continues, the price of nearby&nbsp;soybeans futures rose above its level of technical resistance.</p>

<p>As the monthly chart shows, soybeans rose to the most recent high of $10.7975 on Oct. 9, surpassing the March 2018 peak of $10.71 per bushel. The next level on the upside stands at the Jun. 2016 apex of $12.0850 from June 2016. At the end of last week, November soybeans were at the $10.50 per bushel level.</p><h2><strong>Corn approaches $4</strong></h2><p>While soybeans rose to a new multi-year high, corn&nbsp;did not yet surpass the $4 per bushel. The coarse grain reached a high of $3.9925 on Oct. 12.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The monthly chart shows that technical resistance in corn futures is at the October 2019 peak of $4.0250. The next level on the upside stands at $4.6425 per bushel, the June 2019 high. Corn was above the $4.00 level at the end of last week.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><strong>Wheat moves to a six-year high </strong></h2><p>The most dramatic technical move in the grain sector over recent weeks came in the CBOT soft red winter wheat futures market.</p>

<p>On Oct. 16, December CBOT wheat futures reached a high of $6.3075 per bushel, the highest price since 2014.</p>
<p>Technical resistance had been the August 2018 high at $5.93 and at $6.1575 per bushel in June 2015.</p>
<p>Six years ago, CBOT wheat futures rose to $6.77 in December 2014 and $7.35 per bushel in May 2014. Wheat for December delivery on the CBOT was trading at over $6.25 per bushel on Friday, Oct. 16.</p><h2><strong>Elevated grains translate to higher meat prices</strong></h2><p>One of the primary determinates of meat prices is feed, and grains are the basis for animal feeds. Soybean meal is one of the direct inputs for raising chickens, cattle and hogs.</p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img title=""Cattle Futures Weekly Chart"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic9ba9fbbe42ce39745004ecf0404aacad.png"" alt=""Cattle Futures Weekly Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Cattle Futures Weekly Chart</span></div></div></div><p></p>

<p>After reaching a bottom at 37 cents per pound in April, the price of nearby <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/lean-hogs"" id=""5fc34910d6b8e"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8913"">lean hog futures</a></span> has been moving up and was at almost the 70 cents per pound level at the end of last week.</p>
<p>The price of pork fell to the lowest price since 2002 and has recovered. While the global pandemic and issues with the supply chain caused beef and pork prices to move to multi-year lows earlier in 2020, both have recovered. Elevated grain prices increase feed prices for animal protein producers and are a bullish factor for the meats. <span style=""display: none;"">ihher higher </span></p>
<p><span style=""display: none;"">&nbsp;</span></p><h2><strong>Mother Nature could throw the commodities that feed the world a curveball in 2021</strong></h2><p>Soybeans, corn and wheat prices have all moved into bullish trends over the past months. Soybeans and wheat rose to multi-year highs, while corn is flirting with the $4 level.</p>
<p>The focus will now shift to the 2020/2021 crop year below the equator. However, since the worlds leading producers of the grains and oilseed are in the northern hemisphere, the weather and demand in the planting, growing and harvest seasons in 2021 will determine if a bull market in the grain sector continues.</p>
<p>The last time the markets experienced a significant supply issue was during the 2012 drought, which pushed the prices of corn and soybeans to all-time highs at $8.4375 and $17.9475 per bushel, respectively. In 2012, wheat rose to a high of $9.4725. Even though the grains have experienced significant rallies, there is a lot of room for increased prices.</p>
<p>According to the US Census Bureau, each quarter, the global population increases by approximately twenty million people. Over eight years, that amounts to 640 million more mouths to fill with nutritional requirements. Any supply issues could send prices to higher levels than during the last bull market that took prices to highs in 2012.</p>
<p>Mother Nature determines the weather. She will be the ultimate arbiter of the path of least resistance of grain prices in 2021. Time will tell if the recent rally is just the start of a bull market in the grain sector.</p>

Inflation in the U.K. has been as stubborn as a 6-year old boy who doesn't want to take a bath after playing in the mud outside! <br><br>To U.K.'s credit, their central bank didn't just sit idly by and watch prices soar. The Bank of England (BOE) has done practically everything they can - from cutting rates to near zero at 0.50% to implementing QE - to stoke inflation, yet nothing worked!<br><br> Since unemployment remains high and growth is weak, talks of the economy falling into stagflation (stagnant growth but high inflation and unemployment) have been making rounds in the market. <br><br>Despite all these, the BOE insists that inflationary pressures will be subdued in the long-run. Central bank officials believe that the slack in their economy brought about by spare capacity and weak demand would eventually drag price levels down, and they do have a good point. After all, businesses are likely to bring prices down in order to pump up demand for their products. <br><br>Besides, it can't be denied the U.K.<a href=""http://www.babypips.com/school/united_kingdom.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow""></a> labor market isn't exactly on the up and up. Their jobless rate currently stands at 8.3% as the number of unemployed people hit its 17-year high of 2.64 million. <br><br>With this downturn in hiring, Britons are less likely to spend. Add to that the fact that high unemployment leads to slower wage growth, sometimes even a decline in wages, which would also dampen demand. <br><br><a href=""http://www.babypips.com/blogs/piponomics/images/111221/uk-inflation-rate.png"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><a href=""http://www.babypips.com/blogs/piponomics/images/111221/uk-inflation-rate.png"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://www.babypips.com/blogs/piponomics/images/111221/uk-inflation-rate.png"" border=""0"" alt=""<span class="" aqpopupwrapper="""" js-hover-me-wrapper""=""""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText""><span class=""</span""></span></span></div></a></div></div><a href=""/currencies/eur-usd"" id=""5fc3451e64500"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""1"">EUR/USD</a> and EUR Short Positions"" width=""525"" height=""298""&gt; <br><br>Based on these, it appears that the BOE was spot on in predicting that inflation would slow down, even though it took quite a while. <br><br>Their annual CPI has actually dropped over the past couple of months from 5.2% to 4.8% and if this trend continues, the BOE's forecasts could actually be realized. BOE member Spencer Dale even predicts that the inflation rate could taper down to as low as 3.0% by March next year. <br><br>The British economy could benefit from this as lower price levels could encourage more people to spend, consequently driving up demand. In effect, businesses would have to increase production to meet the rising demand. <br><br>Of course, this would require more workers so companies would have to step up their hiring as well, leading to an uptick in employment. <br><br>While it seems that it will all end happily ever after for the U.K., don't forget that there are still plenty of economic challenges on the horizon. Let's wait and see what the future holds for the British economy!<p></p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

<p></p>
<p>The equity market is running on fumes of optimism and, perhaps more so, fear of missing out. When these types of animal spirits are driving prices it is nearly impossible to predict where the mania ends. Tech stocks, mostly Tesla (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/tesla-motors"" id=""5fc348cd4097d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""13994"">TSLA</a></span>), have experienced exuberance not seen since 2000. We all know how that ended.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While we don't necessarily expect such a hard landing, we also know making money in stocks isn't a given. And when the masses assume there is no downside risk in holding stocks, particularly tech stocks, there is bound to be a reality check. For instance, there are masses of young adults with access to the Robinhood app looking to change their lives with stock purchases. It could be argued that Tesla's parabolic rally was partly due to the newfound market access provided to Millenials via mobile apps. If you don't believe me take a stroll into twitter or facebook; trading groups and profiles are flooded with ""get rich quick"" attitudes regarding the stock market.</p>

<p><b>It is hard to believe bonds and notes are elevated with stocks at all-time-highs.</b></p>

<p>The Fed has made it clear, they are not looking to lower rates any time soon. The economy is ""the best ever"" (not true on most metrics but it is certainly doing well). Seasonality is bearish and yields are unattractive. In short, there are very few good reasons to be bullish in Treasuries.</p>

<p>However, before we hit the panic button, lets remember that job growth tends to slow down as an economy reaches full employment, which is virtually where we are now in the US.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CCN reports that, Back in 2009, the unemployment rate hit 10%. Now its down to 4.7%  the lowest rate since 2007. Yes, it recently dropped in May because more Americans dropped out of the job market. But much of the decline in the unemployment rate since 2009 is for good reasons. The economy has added 13.6 million jobs since October 2009 when the unemployment rate hit double digits.</p>
<p>Now were at a moment when the unemployment rate cant go much lower. Typically, job growth tends to slow down  and wage growth tends to go up  as the economy gets closer to full employment. Plus, other recent indicators show improvement. Jobless claims have been below 300,000 for 65 straight weeks. Thats the longest streak since 1973. And the ADP payroll number, which shows private sector hiring, for May was much higher at 173,000 jobs. The May report is already drawing skepticism from some market observers.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Vietnam's mighty rice industry is battling an ancient foe: Rats. The vermin, long a menace to the nation's robust rice farms, eat up up to 20 percent of the nation's annual grain crop and farmers have had enough. They are hiring workers to catch the rats and then dispose of them - sometimes by eating them.</p>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/rough-rice"" id=""5fc3464feaa7c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""13916"">Rice</a></span> is king in Vietnam. The communist country is the world's second largest exporter of the grain and is expected to reap 45 million ton of paddy, or unhusked rice, this year, up 1.9 percent from 2013, according to Reuters.</p>
<p>But in recent years the rat population has imploded and threatened rice crops as snakes and cats have become increasingly popular protein sources in Vietnam. That's a huge problem for rice farmers. ""Rats cause hundreds of millions of dollars of damage, before we even mention the risk of communicable diseases,"" said Nguyen Manh Hung of the Institute of Agricultural Sciences.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that government officials want farmers to protects rice crops without using chemicals. But rats are difficult to catch. ""We used to have to accept the loss of large chunks of our paddies - the rats destroyed it. It made us wonder why we bothered working so hard,"" 46-year-old farmer Hoang Thi Tuyet told News 24. ""It's hard to trap them, they're clever, they move fast and in Vietnam there are 43 different species of rat to contend with.""</p>
<p>In Thai Binh, near Hanoi, government officials are encouraging farmers to kill rats by giving out cats to people who turn in rat tails. That means for some, rat killing has become a lucrative trade.</p>
<p>Tran Quang Thieu, who goes by the name ""Rat King"", catches about 10kg of rats in rice paddies near Hanoi on a typical day. He uses a special rat trap he created himself that relies on very strong springs. He said he has killed millions of rats. ""The agricultural losses caused by rats are enormous - and these rodents can cause fires and explosions by chewing electric cables in houses and factories,"" he told News 24.</p>
<p>Thieu said he gets requests from all over the country from rice farmers asking him to catch their rats. He said he has sold 30 millions of his special traps to rice farmers in Vietnam and neighboring China and Cambodia.</p>
<p>Grant Singleton, a rodent expert at the International Rice Research Institute, trains farmers in Vietnam on how to kill the rats before they bred. More traditional methods include poisons, traps and electrocution, according to Radio Australia. Some rat hunters then sell their kill to restaurants or farmers to feed their livestock.</p>
<p>Vietnam's total rice export volume for 2014 is expected to be between 6.3 million and 6.5 million ton, excluding the grain sold to China, according to the Vietnam Food Association.</p>    <div class=""clear""></div>"
1606632808-3304,https://www.investing.com/commodities/rough-rice-opinion/6,The Eurozone Is Saved?,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-eurozone-is-saved-109481,"By Lance RobertsMarket OverviewDec 22, 2011 02:10AM ET","Overnight European banks swamped the ECB's first-ever three-year liquidity operation to the tune of, and much larger than expected, 489.2 Billion. That is the LARGEST EVER single refinancing operation in the ECB's history. The three-year loans are expected to ease liquidity strains across Europe as the region has been locked out of public funding markets recently on fears of the worsening sovereign debt crisis. The Long Term Refinancing Operation (LTRO) were offered at an interest rate that will be the average of ECB's main interest rate over the next three years. That benchmark rate is, after a rate cut earlier this month, at a record low of 1.0 percent. For some banks, that could be more than 3 percentage points cheaper than they can get on the open market.<br><br>Previously banks have been reluctant to go to the ECB for assistance to avoid being seen as weak. However, French banks have almost quadrupled their intake of funds since this past June to 150 Billion, with banks in Italy and Spain each taking in more than 100 Billion. Of course, as a consequence, those are the poster children for the media headlines of late. However, this was not the case overnight, as 523 banks lined up with their hands out for these extended loans.<br><br>This is not the first time, by the way, that long-term loans have been granted by the ECB.&nbsp;&nbsp; In June of 2009 a then record of 442 Billion one-year loans were offered, with the majority of those extremely low-cost loans used to buy higher yielding sovereign debt known as a ""carry trade"". This was very profitable for the banks ... until the sovereign debt issues started to become a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; With more than 720 Billion worth of bonds needing refinancing next year, banks scrambled to take advantage of long term cheap money. The hope is that the ultra-cheap and ultra-long funding operation will help bolster confidence in the banking system, particularly since much of the take up of the loans came from the Eurozone's most debt-laden states.<br><br>So, with a stroke of a pen on the dotted line the Euro-crisis is solved....right?<br><br><strong>Not So Fast</strong><br><br>There is no denying that this does help ameliorate short term risks of a ""Lehman-style"" liquidity crisis. However, while an interbank lending crunch may have been avoided, it is much less certain banks will use the money to buy Italian and Spanish government debt, as French President Nicolas Sarkozy has urged, given the competing pressures on them to cut risk, rebuild capital and lend to businesses. The bankers, being sharp financial people, took advantage of the long-term offering to swap out of 280 Billion of shorter term facilities and loans, including 46 Billion from the 12-month LTRO just this past October. Therefore, once you do that math, the net increase in liquidity is about 210 Billion.<br><br>The hope is that, with the ECB lengthening maturities on loans, and with their encouragement, the ultimate allure of the ""carry trade"" (and its shear profitability), banks will purchase new sovereign debt and lend money to businesses. In turn, it is further hoped that this will change the tide in the European debt crisis, since there will be buyers for every new issue that comes to market, providing plenty of liquidity into the system and allowing business to return to normal. There is a lot of ""hope"" going on here.<br><br>The real issue, however, is that without the ECB providing a liquidity option, the Euro crisis still remains unsolved. The ECB's role of being the ""lender of last resort"" and aggressively buying the sovereign debt directly from Italy and Spain is something it has been, and remains, reluctant to do.&nbsp;&nbsp; Without that ""bazooka"", the recent operation is very likely to come up short of intended goals. Furthermore, the demand for loans by businesses is woefully anemic, and with the Eurozone quickly pushing into recession that demand is likely to fall further.<br><br>In my opinion, the more realistic outlook is that the banks have been burned now badly enough that they will likely use the long-dated loans to continue to de-risk their portfolios and balance sheets and reduce their borrowing. While it will take some pressure off of money market assets, as banks won't be scrambling daily for liquidity into the end of the year, it will likely not lead to a massive surge in new asset purchases by banks. The banks are already struggling with a recessionary economy, weak loan demand, and lower profitability, and they know that the markets will ultimately punish them if they load up on debts of insolvent countries along with the underlying mark-to-market risks. Furthermore, the looming threat of the European Banking Association (EBA) ""stress tests"" coming next year will act as a major disincentive. Why? Because they fear the EBA will require more capital for banks holding peripheral debt, which will dilute existing equity. &nbsp;<br><br>So, while these operations once again postpone the inevitable, they do not fix the economic problems of the debt laden countries. There has been no resolution that gets these economies growing again, reduces their debt-to-GDP ratios or increases their economic prosperity. With the near-term needs of the Eurozone roughly 2.5 Trillion, the recent LTRO barely covers 20% of what is ultimately going to be needed. The first quarter of 2012 is loaded with refinancing needs for the banks, which is why there is a second LTRO planned for February 29th.<br><br>This brings up a final point. The ECB is lending money to the banks in exchange for collateral, which is the same basic program that the Fed ran domestically. This is when we saw the banks packaging up toxic loans into a AAA rated securities and pledging them to the Fed as collateral for loans. Those assets still reside in the dark crevices of the Feds off-balance sheet accounting. The recent LTRO has pushed the ECB's balance sheet to a record 2.7 Trillion, with the February LTRO pushing it well over 3 Trillion. The Bernanke Plan has gone global.<br><br>Currently the belief is that the worlds central banks have an unlimited balance sheet as long as they can print their own currency into infinity. However, I question that belief, because no one really knows the unintended consequences of these bailout operations and the massive expansion of balance sheets with near toxic assets. What happens if there is a sharp rise in interest rates that is unable to be countered by central bank programs? Or an eventual default by a sovereign country? Its my guess that it will ultimately be the citizens of Euroville who will find out that the Grinch stole their Christmas.        <div class=""clear""></div>"

<p dir=""ltr"">A dearth of economic data on the <a href=""/economic-calendar/?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=CTA"">calendar</a> might also leave forex players with few leads other than the US-Sino trade war, which has so far played to the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/us-dollar-index"" id=""5fc3473ac5740"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8827"">dollar</a></span>s strength and translated to weak prices for commoditiesgiven Chinas gigantic demand for raw materials. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc3473ac57e0"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">Gold</a></span> in particular <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/news/commodities-news/gold-prices--weekly-outlook-september-17--21-1611882"" id=""5fc3473ac7541"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""oal"" data-articleid=""1611882"">could weaken</a></span> if the dollar rallies.</p>

<h3><strong>Storm Swings For Ag Prices</strong></h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">As for Hurricane Florence, which made landfall in the US Carolinas last week, the death toll being reported at time of writing is at least 18, with dozens of communities devastated. But the storms full impact on commodities isnt known yet, with divergent views so far on what the outcome could be.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">US lean hog prices ran up on Friday in anticipation of pig farm disasters from the hurricane.

<h3>Iran Rhetoric vs Bearish Oil Data</h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">In US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, the trading upside will likely be $70. UK <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/brent-oil"" id=""5fc3473ac5b2d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8833"">Brent</a></span> crude could, meanwhile, reattempt last weeks $80 high on Iranian supply worries.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic041278048c6f4ee48da657444e7debe5.jpeg"" alt=""Brent 300-Min Chart"" title=""Brent 300-Min Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Brent 300-Min Chart</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The volatility in the market is just killing people, Scott Shelton, an oil broker for ICAP) in Durham, North Carolina wrote on Friday as both WTI and Brent reacted to the push and pull of the rhetoric over Iran versus bearish global oil data.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Data last week from the US <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/crude-oil-inventories-75"" id=""5fc3473ac6be8"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""75"">Energy Information Administration</a></span>, the Vienna-based Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the Paris-centered International Energy Agency all projected less demand growth for oil than previously forecast.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The caution flag is flying that the global economy could also slow a bit, said Dominick Chirichella, director of risk management and trading at the DTN-owned Energy Management in New York.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Even so, fears about a total freeze in Iranian oil exports beginning November 3 is providing strong support to crude prices, some say.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">For weeks, the oil market has shifted between the two narratives: the first is that prices could hit $100 per barrel or more once US sanctions against Tehran reach their full potential. The other is that WTI might tank to $60 or below if the shortfall in Iranian supplies are covered by additional US shale and OPEC pumping, and demand for oil at large begins to wither due to the US-Sino trade war.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Investing.coms daily technical outlook has a Sell on WTI, with Fibonacci patterns indicating support could drop to as low as $66.98, versus Fridays settlement of $68.99.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">For Brent, a Strong Buy is recommended, with the hardest resistance seen emerging at $80.43 onward, versus last weeks peak of $80.13.</p>
<h3>Strong Sell Call In Copper</h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">In copper, Investing.coms daily technicals call for a Strong Sell, with Fibonacci Level 3 support dropping to as low as $2.6000 per lbindicating a potential loss of nearly 5 cents from Fridays settlement of $2.6460.</p>
<p>Money managers added aggressively to their net bearish position in New York-traded copper last week on the prospect that US exports of the <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-copper/what-dr-copper-ordered-trade-war-gives-china-metal-a-shot-in-the-arm-idUSKCN1L712G"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">metal in scrap form</a> to China might cost more under new tariffs that could hamper demand for the commodity.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The net short in US copper held by hedge funds and other large speculators was 8,894 contracts during the week to September 11, versus 5,977 in the previous week to September 4, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Friday.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We suspect that any progress on the trade front will take time to materialize, which suggests that traders will continue to shun the red metal's firm fundamentals for the moment, TD Securities said in a note at the weekend.</p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

Prices were last above this average on March 1. Speculative investors appear to have been taking note of this failure and reduced net long positions for a third straight week, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-silver-speculative-net-positions-1621"" id=""5fc347db5f59a"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1621"">CFTC</a></span> data as of March 19 shows. Net-long positions are now at the lowest since the week of December 18.</p>
<p>The gold/silver (Mint) ratio has been trading within the parameters of an 84.0 to 85.5 corridor this month and is currently at 85.074.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/palladium"" id=""5fc347db5ec12"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8883"">Palladium</a></span></strong> traded above the psychological 1,600 mark for the first time last week on continuing shortage concerns. Speculative investors have been using the metals current rally to take profit on long positions, as they reduced their net longs for a fourth straight week in the week to March 19. Net long positions are now at the lowest since the week of October 30, according to the latest data from CFTC.</p>
<p>The global shortage is further evidenced by exchange-traded funds reducing their palladium holdings by 625 troy ounces last Friday, Bloomberg reported. However, the 17% drop in car sales in China during February, even though it included the Lunar New Year period, may raise concerns about demand in the future, since Chinas push for greener emissions in its automobiles has been one of the major drivers of palladium demand.</p>
<p>Some analysts expect the metals bullish run to peter out as the year progresses, according to a recent Bloomberg survey. The average year-end forecast for palladium among poll respondents was about $1,350.</p>

Its now at 858.68. The 55-day moving average at 823.15 is above the 200-day moving average at 822.34 today for the first time since April 30. This so-called golden cross is viewed as a longer-term bullish signal.</p>

The metal touched 2.8265, the lowest since February 19, and is now at 2.8452. The 55-day moving average is at 2.8084 and on a rising trend.</p>
<p>Speculative investors trimmed net longs for a second straight week in the week to March 19, the latest <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-copper-speculative-net-positions-1620"" id=""5fc347db5f636"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1620"">CFTC</a></span> data shows. Chinas ferronickel imports hit an all-time high in January-February, according to China customs data, with imports from Indonesia accounting for a whopping 71% of the total. The same customs data showed <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/copper"" id=""5fc347db5ee27"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8831"">copper</a></span> imports from Chile at a record 789,787 tons in February. Copper stockpiles at the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell by 5,429 tons in the week to March 22.</p>

Speculative accounts are most bullish on oil prices since last October after increasing net long positions for the past five weeks, according to <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-crude-oil-speculative-net-positions-1653"" id=""5fc347db5f6d8"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1653"">CFTC</a></span> data. Perhaps they believe that OPEC will win the supply war with the US, with its cuts overcoming the US increases in production. Chinas imports of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc347db5ef7c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">crude oil</a></span> in February were up 21.6% from a year earlier, according to the China customs data.</p>
<p>The OPEC planned cuts have caused Citibank to raise its oil price forecasts for <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/brent-oil"" id=""5fc347db5f02b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8833"">Brent crude</a></span>. It increased its Q2 target by $9 to $69 per barrel, its Q3 estimate to $74 per barrel and its Q4 forecast to $72 per barrel.</p>
<p>Crude oil prices have tested the 50% retracement level of the October-December drop at $59.653 and, after one close above the level on March 20, have failed to do so for the past three days. WTI is now at $58.954 with the 200-day moving average at $61.736.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/natural-gas"" id=""5fc347db5f0cf"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8862"">Natural gas</a></span></strong> has failed to gain any upward momentum despite news that some gas platforms off the coast of Western Australia had been evacuated as a precaution due to the proximity of cyclone Veronica. Chinas February LNG imports from the US were down 50% from January, according to the latest data from the China customs bureau.</p>
<p>Natural gas is now at 2.762 and continues to be capped in the near term by the 55-day moving average, which is at 2.886 today. Prices have been below this average since December 24.</p>
<h3><strong>Agriculture</strong></h3>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc347db5f178"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">Corn</a></span></strong> looks poised for its third weekly advance in a row as it heads toward the seven-week high of 3.766. Its now at 3.722 after climbing for the past five sessions, boosted by news on Friday that US exporters had sold 300,000 tons of corn to China, the biggest deal in five years, which triggered hopes of a pickup in demand. Customs data showed that Chinas corn imports in February were up 14.5% from a year earlier at 570,000 tons.</p>
<p>Speculative investors were net buyers for the first time in six weeks in the week to March 9, according to the latest data snapshot from <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-corn-speculative-net-positions-1813"" id=""5fc347db5fbb1"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1813"">CFTC</a></span>, though accounts are still carrying net short positions, which are near to the highest since November 2017.</p>

Prices rebounded from the support area but still closed in the red yesterday at 0.12539.</p>
<p>On the supply side, Indias sugar output in the October 1 to March 15 period was up 5.9% y/y at 27.35 million tons, while Russias output for the 2019-20 season is seen steady, according to a local producers group.</p>

<p>We could very well be at the bottom of this correction. <br><b> </b> <br><b>What are the chances of a further pullback?</b></p>
<p>Before we go any further, I would like to highlight again that <b>this pullback is more the result of negative sentiment rather than negative fundamentals</b>. We have also shown in the charts above that we might be already near a bottom. But what about in the unlikely event this line does not hold?</p>
<p>Here it is important to note that today we do not have the ""triggers"" for a typical bear market to happen. Historically, ""bear markets"" have happened in the past for the following reasons:</p>
<ul><li>An economic recession in the United States, or in another major global economy such as Europe or China</li>
<li>An asset bubble, such as a stock price bubble or real estate price bubble</li>
<li>Technology stock speculations and technology stock bubbles</li>

<p>Clearly today <b>none of the above ingredients or triggers are available</b>. The most frequent trigger for a bear market is an economic recession. Economic recessions are scary because, during recessions, companies start to struggle and post fewer profits. This results in a deterioration of the underlying fundamentals, and corporate profits start to decline. <b>This is not the situation today</b>. The state of the U.S. economy is solid and enjoying a period of low <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/unemployment-rate-300"" id=""5fc34759a1b7a"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""300"">unemployment</a></span> and low inflation. According to the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/fed-chair-powell-speaks-1738"" id=""5fc34759a1c20"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1738"">Fed Chairman</a></span> himself, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/gdp-375"" id=""5fc34759a1cc1"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""375"">GDP</a></span> for the year 2019 will be healthy, and that growth will be above average and his assessment of the economy is 100% correct. We can come to the same conclusion by looking at the ""probability of a U.S. recession chart"" produced by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. <br><a href=""https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/12/23/16392-1545591098440247_origin.jpg"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""></a><i><u><a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/capital_markets/Prob_Rec.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""></a></u></i></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><i><u><a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/capital_markets/Prob_Rec.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picdeaf385d95cb237473f6bf17b9d5d397.5226"" border=""0"" alt=""Risks of a recession"" title=""Risks of a recession""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Risks of a recession</span></div></a></u></i></div></div><i><u><a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/capital_markets/Prob_Rec.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><br>Source</a></u></i><p></p>
<p>It is highly unlikely that a recession will happen in 2019. The most frequent trigger for a bear market is just not here.</p>
<p>Other reasons that have triggered a bear market in the past include extreme valuations, high commodity prices and aggressive rate hikes. We also do not have any of these other triggers today. Valuations are very reasonable if not low, commodity prices are <b>very low </b>based on historical standards and interest rates remain around their all-time lows. However, we do have fears that the Fed may be overly aggressive in its rate hikes, although these fears are overblown. <br><b><br>What if a deeper bear market happens?</b> <br>Because we do not have the ""triggers"" for a typical bear market, the chances are that it will be a relatively mild one and unlikely to last long, <b>simply because macroeconomic factors do not support it</b>. Remember, the current pullback has little to do with fundamentals and more to do with negative investors' sentiment. Even if this scenario plays out, the worst of the downturn is likely to be behind us. <br><b><br>Dividend Stocks Set to Outperform</b> <br>Heading into the New Year, there are two main factors that we need to be aware of:</p>
<ol><li>Earnings will be decelerating in every quarter of 2019. This isnt too surprising considering the phenomenal earnings in 2018. For the 4th quarter of 2019, the S&amp;P 500 companies' earnings are expected to slow to an annual pace of 17.4%, down from 28.2% in the third quarter. That is still fast, but considerably slower than 2018.</li>
<li>Interest rate hikes will also decelerate or even stop altogether. If we look at the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/rates-bonds/u.s.-10-year-bond-yield"" id=""5fc34759a1931"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""23705"">10-Year</a></span> Treasury yields, they pulled back from 3.2% to 2.8% meaning that investors are already factoring in lower inflation and lower interest rate expectations.</li>
</ol><p><b>What this means is that there is a massive leadership change underway. </b>Lower earnings growth coupled with lower interest rate expectations provides a very favorable backdrop for high dividend stocks and sectors. It will be imperative for income investors to identify those high-yielding dividend stocks that will be able to grow earnings and cover their dividends, even in a situation where economic growth slows.</p>
<p>With the 10-year Treasury yields below 3% and the dividend yield on the S&amp;P 500 at only 2%, high-yielding stocks of 6% and above will be in high demand. Yield-hungry investors will continue to pour into dividend stocks. Furthermore, over the next few years, thousands of people in the United States will reach retirement age, and will be looking to re-allocate to high dividend stocks. The aging population phenomenon is not only affecting the United States; this is a global trend. Retirees across the globe are looking for yield, and there is no better place to invest than the United States.</p>
<p>Overall, because of decelerating earnings and sales environment for the stock market, investor speculation in risky technology companies is expected to slow down. Companies with stable and recurrent cash flows offering big dividend payouts to shareholders will lead this market. <br><b><br></b><strong>Overview</strong><br>The prices of equities today are factoring a deep recession and a disaster scenario which is unlikely to happen. The stock market will rebound. Good stocks always bounce back. It is only a matter of ""when"". <b>We have made the case in the above charts that we could be near a bottom</b>, <b>which represents a great buying opportunity. A recovery could start as soon as this week.</b></p>
<p>Even in a worst-case scenario where a deeper ""bear market"" materializes, it will be the result of an overshoot to the downside and we do not expect it to last long.</p>
<p>We remain optimistic about the state of equities, <b>and lots of money will be made from these levels.</b> Bargain hunting is already happening behind the scenes by institutional investors. ""Smart money"" has been buying under the surface which tells me that the bottom is near. The markets are currently offering tremendous opportunities in the high yield space. For income investors and retirees, it is one of the best time to start picking up high-quality dividend stocks on the cheap. This sale is unlikely to last long. <br><b><br></b></p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

<p>Those who had banked on the event to bring gas futures back to $4 levels now face the specter of more corrections as supply remains undesirably high while the frigid weather that ensures high and consistent heating demand hasnt held.</p>
<p>With just a week of trading left to 2018, natural gas is still the top performing commodity of the year. But the huge gap it once had with other markets has narrowed dramatically after three straight weeks of price drops.</p>
<h3><strong>Nat Gas Once Huge Gap With Other Commodities Narrowed</strong></h3>
<p><strong></strong></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><strong><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picbfe71524ff2c3b2848f9eff508511364.jpeg"" alt=""NatGast 5-Hour Chart"" title=""NatGast 5-Hour Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">NatGast 5-Hour Chart</span></div></strong></div></div><p></p>
<p>At Thursdays settlement of $3.726 per million metric British thermal units (mmBtu), the front-month January contract was up about 25 percent on the year. Three weeks ago, that gain was 55 percent, while in late November it was nearly 60 percent. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc34755c45e5"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">Wheat</a></span>, the commodity with the second highest returns, was up 22 percent on the year, just a little behind natural gas (desktop users, click <a href=""/commodities/real-time-futures"">here</a> and go to performance to see all commodity returns for 2018).</p>
<p>Until spring this year, gas prices were muted, trading well below $3 per mmBtu. From May, the market took off, on a wave of cooling demand first, and later heating.</p>
<p>The first demand surge was during the summer, when utilities had to burn unusually large amounts of gas each week to meet spikes in power usage caused by the heavy use of air-conditioners at that time to beat the hot weather. The next demand wave was caused by an unexpected burst of cold during the fall season that led to premature heating demand.</p>
<p>A ramp up in exports of liquefied natural gas has also boosted the demand equation for US natural gas this year. From just around 3 bcf per day a year ago, LNG export capacity is almost at 5 bcfd now. The EIA expects it to reach nearly 9 bcfd by the end of next year, making the United States the third largest LNG exporter after Qatar and Australia.</p>
<h3><strong>Mixed Weather Hitting Gas Consumption</strong></h3>
<p>But with gas prices topping nearly $5 per mmBtu in November, their highest since 2014, weather patterns became more mixed, affecting demand. Production, meanwhile, remained not far from the record highs seen earlier in the year. The result was a higher accumulation of gas in underground storage caverns than desired. While weekly consumption of at least 100 billion cubic feet was required to keep prices at the years high, there had only been two such triple-digit drawdowns over the past five weeks. And last weeks draw of 141 bcf was even lower than the five-year average of 144 bcf for this time of year.</p>
<p>Dan Myers, analyst at Gelber &amp; Associates, a consultancy in Houston, noted that last weeks draw was the second consecutive one to fall under the five-year average, despite a strong shot of colder-than-normal temperatures in the first half of December. Said Myers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Firm supply has softened recent withdrawals and will have a chance to really dampen withdrawals during the current spate of milder weather, especially if it is bolstered by further production growth late this month.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>More Downside Than Upside For Prices</strong></h3>
<p>Myers said there was still chance for extreme cold to override record production this winter, but added that in the near term mostly-normal temperature forecasts will weigh on prices as long as they continue.</p>
<p>Dominick Chirichella, director of risk and trading at the Energy Management Institute (EMI) in New York, concurred. He added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The warming trend for the rest of the year across the main Nat Gas consuming regions of the country is taking center stage and is the current main price driver for the complex.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So how low could prices go?</p>
<p>Myers notes that natural gas contracts from April through December 2019 were averaging near $2.85 per mmBtu, about $1 per mmBtu below benchmark January pricing.</p>
<h3><strong>Weather Forecasts Arent Showing A Lot Of Cold</strong></h3>
<p>And unless it gets a lot colder very quickly, reaching for $4 levels might be difficult over the next two months despite January and February typically being the coldest months of winter.</p>
<p>Chirichella said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Until there is a clear signal that winter like weather is returning, Nat Gas prices are likely to remain on the defensive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And upcoming weather trends arent encouraging. Latest short-term temperature forecasts show normal temperatures reappearing over the upper US Midwest and stretching out to New England.</p>
<p>The eight to fourteen-day forecast is also less supportive than the shorter term forecast. It shows that the cold weather expected in the western third of the country would be more than offset by above normal temperatures prevailing over most of the US.</p>
<p>Added Chirichella:</p>
<p>I am maintaining my NatGas view and bias to cautiously bearish as the market is now below another range support level.</p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

<p>Corn is sown during winter time and is harvested in late summer; it needs a non-stop water supply and hot climates.</p>
<p>The progress in corn growing methods and the development of the complex resistance to pests species obtained by bio-technological treatment, along with the use of sophisticated computerized equipment, yielded larger crops of fine grains in a smaller land area.</p>
<p>Corn is the first of its scope in terms of crops in the United States, and the annual value amounted to 76.5 billion in 2011. The States produces about 40% of the global corn, consumes about 35%, and exports 61% of global corn exports. The main use of corn in the United States is as food for livestock, but there are also other uses. During the past 15 years, the ratio in corn uses has changed massively. So if in 2001, 75% was used in animal feed, and 8% for ethanol production, by 2011 only 44% was used as food for livestock and about 40% was used for ethanol.</p>
<p>Ethanol is the alcohol known to us all as the main ingredient of alcoholic beverages. It is currently used as an only component in fuel for cars or as a supplement to gasoline. Ethanol combustion is cleaner than the gasoline's and pollutes the air less. The addition of ethanol to gasoline increases the octane blend. A standard mixture of fuel stations in the United States consists of 90% gasoline and 10% ethanol. The aim is to increase the percentage of ethanol mixture, thus reducing the amount of imported <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc345bf3e6b5"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">oil</a></span>.</p>
<p>In 2014, corn noted a price drop of more than 29% and most people like to put the blame for that on China. Both corn and wheat prices fell due to the improving technology and fertilization tools that made agricultural crops more successful. As well, each production cycle is more efficient when the weather is fine, and therefore the supply increased.</p>
<p>But if that is the case, how come we are noticing the movements in corn prices?</p>
<p>Well, the first reason is of course the growth of beef consumption in the US especially, and in the rest of the world as well.</p>
<p>The logic is very simple. When beef consumption grows, farmers must raise more cows, chickens and the rest of all those animals, which must eat before they finish as a stimulating steak on our plate.</p>
<p>The second reason is, in one word, China.</p>
<p>It was said that ""Chinese consumption grew faster than GDP in the past,"" but now is lagging behind. Another headache is created that China, which drew raw materials, is becoming an exporter of stainless steel and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/aluminum"" id=""5fc345bf3e754"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""49768"">aluminum</a></span>, thanks to the abundance of power, continuous improvement technological capabilities and excess production capacity.</p>
<p>As a result, Chinese exporters have to rely on other goods for the purpose of growth. China consumers are demanding dairy products, chocolate and jewelry, and of course, meat, from the same kind that must be fed. Preferably with corn.</p>
<p>It's easy to see that some things never change.</p>
<p>And while companies rise and fall, stock prices shoot up and drop and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc345bf3e7f1"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">gold</a></span> prices are suffering from a bipolar disorder, agricultural commodities will always be needed everywhere.<br></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic86dcc2848a43cf4298c04105f9073e28.png"" alt=""Corn Weekly Chart"" title=""Corn Weekly Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Corn Weekly Chart</span></div></div></div><p></p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

<p>It was another week of falling prices for soft commodities, as oversupply issues continue to dominate across all the major markets. This is clearly evident from the weekly charts.</p>
<p>As the largest exporter, it is the US which sets the price for world markets, with the US Midwest <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc345b96b1ee"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">corn</a></span> belt set to produce a record harvest for a second year. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc345b96b458"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span> too are expected to generate the largest crop ever on record.</p>
<p>This picture of bumper harvests is also mirrored in Canada, and even events in the Ukraine and Russia have had little impact on prices.

All of this is in sharp contrast to the shortages which were the catalyst for a surge in prices in 2007, which in turn sparked riots in many countries around the globe.</p>
<p>If we start with soybeans, the key price action here was the breach of potential support in the 1030 per bushel region early in September which failed to hold. The market duly broke lower on high volume, with last weeks price action closing on a wide spread down candle and high volumes, ending at 910.25 per bushel. Soybean prices are now approaching a second and perhaps even more significant area of potential support in the 900 per bushel region. If this is breached, we can expect to see the commodity move through this level and lower still, perhaps to test the 840 per bushel region in the longer term. In overnight trading on Globex, soybean prices have fallen once more with the November contract trading at 906.00 per bushel.</p>
<p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/piccbf86ab5fbca66ef0e513840c67a8c1d.png"" alt=""Corn Futures Weekly"" title=""Corn Futures Weekly""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Corn Futures Weekly</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p>Moving to corn, the picture here is much the same as for soybeans, although perhaps at a slightly more measured pace. Here the decline in prices has been less pronounced over the last three weeks, but nevertheless the bearish picture remains dominant as corn, like soybeans and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc345b96c786"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">wheat</a></span>, is largely being driven lower by the supply equation.</p>
<p>Last weeks price action was accompanied by above average volume, following the weakness signaled in the previous week with the deep upper wick to the candle. The key level here is in the 300 per bushel region, where a minor support region awaits. If this is broken, then 260 per bushel becomes the next logical region for a pause, where a deep area of price congestion may finally bring the current bearish trend to an end. This was the level back in May 2010, which saw prices surge from 270 per bushel up to 630 per bushel. The December contract closed last week at 323 per bushel and overnight on Globex has climbed marginally to trade at 324.50 per bushel at time of writing.</p>
<p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picfd473f9a7580d03622db5f55660a08eb.png"" alt=""December Wheat Weekly Chart"" title=""December Wheat Weekly Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">December Wheat Weekly Chart</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p>Finally to wheat, and here perhaps we are starting to see the first signs of a pause point, following the sharp declines of the previous three weeks with last weeks candle closing as a small doji candle, but on high volume. This is an obvious anomaly for volume price analysis traders, clearly signalling buyers moving into the market at this level, and the first signs of stopping volume in the downward trend.</p>
<p>As always, I must stress, markets rarely reverse a trend on one candle, but nevertheless, this is the first sign that perhaps soft commodity prices, and wheat in particular, are just starting to find a bottom. Indeed, in overnight trading on Globex the December contract is currently trading at 478.50 per bushel, moving off last weeks close of 474.25. Whilst one swallow does not make a summer, it will be interesting to see any reaction in the associated markets, particularly, of course, for corn. The probability will be that this is simply a pause point, before a further move lower. However, for commodity traders in wheat it may be a case of trade what you see and not what you think in the coming week.</p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

Instead, its turning out to be the year when commodity bears pulled off the biggest upset in oil and left deep losses that could take long to fix almost everywhere else in the sector.</p>
<p>Raw materials futures standing tall after the carnage of 2018 are few and far between. The biggest winners are some of the smallest markets.</p>

<h3><strong>Falling Along With Equities</strong></h3>
<p>While each subsector of the commodity asset classenergy, metals and agricultureis down, what surprises some market watchers is the near breakdown in the inverse relationship between commodities and equities. The 21-component <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/bloomberg-commodity"" id=""5fc346ee1b01b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""948434"">Bloomberg Commodity Index</a></span> is down 8 percent while Wall Streets broadest stock index, the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/us-30"" id=""5fc346ee1b597"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""169"">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a></span>, is struggling to show a gain too.</p>
<p>Typically, commodities offer investors the opportunity for diversification, meaning they should rally when stocks are down. The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/us-dollar-index"" id=""5fc346ee1b64d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8827"">Dollar Index</a></span>, another contrarian bet to commodities, has performed to expectations, however, rising 6 percent on the year.</p>
<p>So, how did an asset class that began the year with such promiseGoldman said just before 2018 started that the backdrop for commodities demand was even stronger than a year ago, with robust and synchronous global growth clearly evident""crash and burn this way?</p>
<h3><strong>Trade War Started It All</strong></h3>
<p>It all started with the dollar rally forerunning the US-China trade war in April, before the tariff battle between the two countries itself started eating into demand for metals and grainstwo of Chinas biggest imports from the United States. Even then, oil prices continued to rally for nearly five months through October, reaching four-year highs, on US President Donald Trumps threats to bring Iranian crude exports to zero.</p>
<p>Then, as aggressively as the year began for commodity bulls, it started reversing after the US sanctions on Tehran oil shipments turned out to be softer than thought. US crude production also reached all-time highs alongside Saudi and Russian output.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the suspicion that it was state-engineered put the Saudis and their OPEC cartel at the mercy of Trump, whos since been pressuring Riyadh to keep its oil production high and prices low in order to avoid US sanctions for the killing.</p>
<h3><strong>Oils Weakness Becomes Commodities Weakness</strong></h3>
<p><strong></strong></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><strong><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic96f1ef15d5600053bc463f43382eda3a.jpeg"" alt=""WTI Weekly Chart"" title=""WTI Weekly Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">WTI Weekly Chart</span></div></strong></div></div><p></p>
<p>The result: The most prolonged bear market for oil thats now weighing across the raw materials complex.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/goldman-sachs-group"" id=""5fc346ee1b709"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""266"">GS</a></span>), in a note this week, said the current weakness of commodities was remarkable considering there was no recession in play and the global economy was due to grow 3.5 percent in 2019. While the tame US sanctions on Iran might have been the catalyst for the plunge in oil, it wasnt the reason for its continued selloff, the Wall Street bank said, adding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We believe the answer lies in the lack of discretionary risk capital devoted to commodity markets. Without discretionary traders, systematic traders become a far larger share of the market and are having an outsized influence on commodity prices.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Blame The Machine, Not The Man</strong></h3>
<p>These systematic traders were not just traders but often algorithmsor machines programmed to execute trades like humans, but typically without consideration for fundamentals.</p>
<p>Such algos, Goldman said, respond to price patterns or perceived risk premia, which become more important than spot fundamentals or even anticipatory views on such fundamentals."" It adds that these trading models were focused on momentum and volatility selling strategies to create alpha or absolute returnwithout a care for real-world logic and other pricing considerations.</p>
<p>Effectively, in the current environment, short-selling strategies were being unwound once they achieved their price target for oil, leading to a volatility spike. Then momentum strategies drove the market down further, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy for even lower prices.</p>
<p>In summation, Goldman says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""With no discretionary money to take the other side, market liquidity is drying up, which reinforces the momentum to the downside, causing commodities to decline more than equities, making them appear to price a more dire demand outlook.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Current Environment 'Unsustainable'</strong></h3>
<p>The Wall Street bank, however, says the current botched environment for oil prices is unsustainable and predicts the situation will correct with an OPEC production cut when the cartel meets on December 6, regardless of Trumps threats. Goldman also expects Trump and China leader Xi Jinping to agree to a trade deal at their summit at the G20 on Friday.</p>

<p>Yet, in the sea of red drowning the commodities complex, a few flickers of green continue to provide hope for longs. One of them is in sugar.</p>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-sugar-no11"" id=""5fc348c14172d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8869"">Raw sugar</a></span> on the ICE (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/intercontintlex"" id=""5fc348c1417e0"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""7907"">ICE</a></span>) Futures U.S. was poised for a third week of gains out of four on Friday, after hitting a high in the previous session that fell just short of the two-year peaks struck last week. Assuming theres no slide on the day, the sweetener could finish the week up 1.5%.</p>
<p></p><h2 dir=""ltr"">Sugar Up Most For Month Since 2018, Oil In Reverse</h2>
<p>But more importantly, with today being the final session of January, raw sugar is also showing a gain of nearly 9% on the month. If it closes again in the positive, it could have the highest monthly gain since October 2018s astronomical gain of nearly 27%.<br><br></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img title=""Sugar Futures Weekly Prices"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic38bfd08deecc27a592ce9805ae787403.png"" alt=""Sugar Futures Weekly Prices""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Sugar Futures Weekly Prices</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p>Now compare that January gain in sugar with how oil has performed for the month. Oils benchmark <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/brent-oil"" id=""5fc348c1418ae"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8833"">Brent crude</a></span> is poised for a loss of more than 12% on month, its deepest slide since November 2018.</p>
<p>And it makes sense to compare sugar with oil because sugars most important commercial by-product is ethanol  the biofuel thats blended with gasoline, or petroleum.</p>
<h2 dir=""ltr"">Sugar Is Just Among A Handful Of Commodities With Monthly Gains</h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>In fact, sugar is one of five leading commodities from a field of 36 that are showing gains for January, Investing.com data shows.

<p>Typically, sugar prices track those of oil given their dependence on gasoline for ethanol blending  which is mandated at 10% in the United States.</p>
<p>But since the coronavirus outbreak, sugar has strangely been marching to its own drum-beat, as traders and investors focus almost entirely on a supply squeeze forced by a weak crop out of top producer Brazil.</p>
<p></p><h2 dir=""ltr"">Massive Production Shortage</h2>
<p>We see sugar prices following through on a rally supported by a massive global production deficit, said Eric Scoles, commodities strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago, adding:</p>
<blockquote>This is still a very bullish market and my analysis suggests strong fundamentals are still in place.</blockquote>
<p>Jack Scoville, vice president and analyst for soft commodities that include sugar at Chicagos Price Futures Group, said Brazil could be forced to produce more sugar and less ethanol due to the current weakness in crude oil prices.</p>
<p>Reports indicate that little is on offer from India. Thailand might also have less this year due to reduced planted area and erratic rains during the monsoon season. Scoville said, referring to the two other major growing centers for sugar.</p>
<h2 dir=""ltr"">Strong Buy</h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>In Thursdays session, raw sugar for March delivery on ICE Futures US settled at 14.59 cents per lb after peaking at 14.87  just short of the two-year high of 14.90 set on Jan. 23.</p><p></p>
<p>Investing.coms Daily Technical Outlook recommends March sugar as a Strong Buy, suggesting a top-end resistance of 15.21 cents for the contract. At Thursdays settlement, that would give the contract room to move up another six cents or 4%.</p>
<p>That would be a sweet move indeed if realized, given the bleak mood across most of the commodities spectrum now bar sugar.</p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

While inclement weather is behind of some of the tightness in the current winter crop, analysts point to the Russian bid to control supplies as another increasingly influential factor.</p>
<h3><strong>Russia At Work To Slow Wheat Exports</strong></h3>
<p>Moscow may have a higher profile in the oil market these days for its collaboration with OPEC on production cuts. But Jack Scoville, vice president at Chicagos Price Futures Group and author of its daily grains report, said his intelligence showed Russia was probably trying just as hard to curtail its wheat exports. Said Scoville:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Russian government is working to limit wheat exports to about 18 million tons through the end of June. It might stop some exporters from selling wheat into the world market.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He said exporters were reported to be having trouble sourcing wheat as any supply near ports had apparently been sold, with the only grain in storage being in the interior. Added Scoville:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ukraine is also having trouble sourcing wheat for export, and the EU has been exporting less as Russia remains the largest wheat exporter in the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shawn Hackett of Hackett Financial Advisors in Boca Raton, Florida, said capital flows into wheat have been very strong since the start of January, reaching levels last seen in early 2018, and providing optimism for higher prices as February approached.</p>
<h3><strong>Winter Kill Threats To Spur Volatility </strong></h3>
<p>Hackett adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we enter the next cold phase of winter season in the Northern Hemisphere, multiple repeated winter kill threats are likely to be seen over the next three months, offering upside price volatility expansion.</p>
<p>This will be happening at a time of strong U.S. exports of high-quality wheat due to last years poor international crops, especially in Russia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hackett said <a href=""https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/kc-wheat_quotes_settlements_futures.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Kansas Hard Red Winter Wheat</a>, the bread-making variant of the grain which settled at $5.15 per bushel on the spot March contract on Wednesday, was well supported at $4.82. End-users would be wise to buy any breaks, should they occur, into this support zone, he added.</p>
<p>Scoville said CME <a href=""https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/wheat_quotes_settlements_futures.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Soft Red Winter Wheat</a>, used for making flour as well as industrial products such as adhesives and starches, was cheaper than most competition at $5.26 per bushel. He added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>World crop reports continue to indicate less production and tightening supplies. Australian and European prices have also been relatively strong. U.S. FOB prices for wheat are at or below just about all of the competition. SRW wheat is still the worlds cheapest wheat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dan Hueber, author of the Hueber Report on grains from St. Charles, Illinois, concurred, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""The CME wheat market is holding ground as well as any market right now with March futures continuing to flirt around resistance here at 5.24.</p>
<p>Daily stochastics have maintained a positive bias and there remains a possibility that we could make a run back to the 5.40/5.45 zone.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Data Vacuum From Shutdown Complicates Bets</strong></h3>
<p>But if theres anything making a bet on wheator for that matter, any graindifficult now, its the absence of crop data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture due to the government shutdown, Scoville said in a news report published this week. He added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You never know what tweets going to come out next and screw up what had been a wonderfully profitable position or at least not a horrid position. You can get hammered in half a tweet.</p>
<p>Theres no export news at all, no demand news at all, except for the weekly export inspections report, which is well after the fact. Were searching for news, youve got to work hard these days.</p>

<p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic043b73855a3380908f2763bfc5ca54fe.jpeg"" alt=""Wheat Daily Chart"" title=""Wheat Daily Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Wheat Daily Chart</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p>From a year-to-date loss of 13% two weeks back, Soft Red Winter wheat, the most liquid U.S. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc347e1cf996"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">wheat futures</a></span> traded in Chicago, cut that deficit to just about 6% at Mondays settlement. SRW wheat has the highest value among the different variants of the grain grown in the U.S., and is integral for producing the flour that makes breads, pasta and crackers, as well as starches and adhesives.</p>
<p>Still, wheat is the only major U.S. grains market remaining in the red as the end of the first quarter approaches. Rivals <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc347e1cfbd2"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">corn</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc347e1cfc8d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span> are both up 1.3% each.</p>
<p>Within the wheat sub-complex, SRW is doing better than Minneapolis-traded Hard Red Spring wheat, which is the United States most abundant crop. HRS wheat, covering Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and the Texas panhandle and used primarily for bread-making, is down 10% year-to-date.</p>
<p>But while SRW and HRS wheat are both down, another bread-making variant of the grain, Kansas City-traded Hard Red Winter wheat, is up 3% on the year. The rally in HRW wheat has raised the probability that the Chicago- and Minneapolis-traded futures of the grain could also turn positive in the not-too-distant future.</p>
<p>Technical analysts on Investing.com are betting on that, rating Chicago-traded wheat a <a href=""/commodities/us-wheat-technical"">Strong Buy</a> in their daily outlook.</p>
<p>At Mondays settlement, Chicago-traded wheats front-month May contract settled at $4.73 per bushel.</p>
<p>The highest analyst-pegged resistance for the contract is $4.81leaving it room to move another 2% up. But a recommendation for a Sell only emerges strongly at the $5 level, when the market, now trading above the 20-Day Moving Average, enters the 100-Day Moving Average. That would be a 6% gain from current levelsjust enough to push it into positive territory.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, the driver behind the gains in SRW wheat that have helped it cut losses in the past two weeks were difficult planting conditions in a very wet U.S. Great Plains and Midwest.</p>
<p>While the prospect of a bullish market in wheat was enticing, some like Mike Seery, a technical chartist and commodities picker in Plainfield, Illinois, were still practicing a little caution.</p>
<p>Said Seery:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think if the weather problems persist, you could see further prices to the upside especially based just on short covering alone. But I am currently advising clients to sit on the sidelines and wait for better chart structure to develop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One surprising factor is the fact that large money-managed funds are short nearly 74,000 contracts and they are adding to their record short position in the Kansas City wheat market which now stands at 51,000 contracts. I'm very surprised especially with the rally that we witnessed over the last couple of weeks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong> </strong>But Seery also believed wheat is too cheap for its current fundamentals, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do believe now that spring is upon us, the bottom in the grain markets may be at hand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dan Hueber of the Hueber Report in St. Charles, Illinois, agrees:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Daily indicators continue to point higher, so we should have potential to try and push higher over the next few days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, Jack Scoville of The Price Futures Group in Chicago argued that weather, more than fund action, would be the driver for wheat hereon.</p>
<p>Said Scoville:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The region will need a lot of good weather before planting can begin. Demand for spring wheat has been less lately due to the price spreads between spring here and competing wheat around the world. A rally in world wheat prices would help improve demand potential for U.S. and Canadian spring wheat.</p>

1606633366-3402,https://www.investing.com/commodities/us-wheat-opinion/7,VIX Under Key Mark Amid Cautious Optimism Sparked By Earnings,https://www.investing.com/analysis/vix-under-key-mark-amid-cautious-optimism-sparked-by-earnings-200383881,"By TD Ameritrade (JJ Kinahan)Market OverviewFeb 05, 2019 12:35PM ET","<p>(Tuesday Market Open) The market is on a roll, driven by earnings-related momentum. Still, geopolitical questions continue to overhang. Meanwhile, volatility is at multi-month lows, as measured by the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/volatility-s-p-500"" id=""5fc34792b8e0d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""44336"">VIX</a></span>. That fear index receded below 16 early this week from above 30 as recently as late December.</p>
<p>It feels like theres a cautious optimism on Wall Street as VIX continues to ease (see more below). Earnings season has been better than expected, and a lot CEOs on the earnings calls have made nice forward-looking statements. However, many investors dont seem to fully trust this rally, with the tariff situation still hanging out there in the balance. Thats brought a bit of nervousness in, and it probably wont go away unless theres some sort of trade deal.</p>
<p>Tonights State of the Union speech might bring more clarity on trade and other issues like the looming deadline for an immigration deal to avoid another government shutdown. Meanwhile, theres more earnings news to absorb with <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/disney"" id=""5fc34792b905c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""258"">Disney</a></span>, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/polo-ralph-laur"" id=""5fc34792b9119"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8022"">Ralph Lauren</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/archer-daniels-mid"" id=""5fc34792b91cd"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8080"">Archer-Daniels-Midland</a></span> reporting today (more below). European markets hit nine-week highs Tuesday amid solid earnings news.</p>
<p>In another apparently bullish development, last nights dinner between President Trump and Fed Chair Jerome Powell appeared to spark more optimism about a Fed rate pause. The Fed issued a statement after the dinner basically re-emphasizing that <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/fed-interest-rate-decision-168"" id=""5fc34792ba3a3"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""168"">rate decisions</a></span> would be data-driven. This echoes what Powell and other Fed officials have been saying for the past month.</p>
<h3><strong>Alphabet Shares Slide As Investors Ponder Costs, Spending</strong></h3>
<p>After Mondays close, Alphabet (<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/google-inc-c"" id=""5fc34792b9683"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""100160"">GOOG</a></span>, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/google-inc"" id=""5fc34792b9732"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""6369"">GOOGL</a></span>) reported earnings and revenue that beat third-party consensus estimates, but shares lost a bit of ground in pre-market trading. GOOGs financials ended the FAANG part of the earnings season, and those stocks had been outpacing the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/us-spx-500"" id=""5fc34792b97d8"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""166"">SPX</a></span> so far this year going into the week (see more below).</p>
<p>Though GOOG appeared to beat Street estimates for many of its key line items, pressure on the stock might have reflected investor concerns about the companys costs and expenses, analysts said. Also, operating earnings fell a bit short of analyst projections. It might be worth considering, too, that shares had risen nearly 7% in just over two weeks leading up to earnings, meaning profit-taking on the news might have been another factor in the post-report selling.</p>
<p>DIS is due to report after the close today, and analysts say it faces tough comparisons with a year ago. The thing investors might want to consider looking for is what DIS executives say about the future of Disney Plus, the companys streaming service, coming on the back of Netflix (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/netflix,-inc."" id=""5fc34792b9879"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""13063"">NFLX</a></span>) <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/netflix,-inc.-earnings"" id=""5fc34792ba59c"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""erl"" data-pairid=""13063"">earnings</a></span>. What are Disneys plans for competing with NFLX? Its a busy space, and a competitive one. Just yesterday, media reports said the FX Networks chief criticized how NFLX measures viewership.</p>
<p>Shares of ADM slipped in pre-market trading as investors absorbed the companys missing third-party consensus <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/archer-daniels-mid-earnings"" id=""5fc34792ba604"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""erl"" data-pairid=""8080"">earnings and revenue</a></span> estimates. The food processors press release referred to what it called complicated and rapidly changing trade, geopolitical and market conditions.</p>
<p>However, apparel maker Ralph Lauren (RL) saw shares surge 8% in the pre-market hours after the company beat analysts estimates. RLs <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/polo-ralph-laur-earnings"" id=""5fc34792ba667"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""erl"" data-pairid=""8022"">performance</a></span> can sometimes help investors get a sense of how high-end shoppers are doing.</p>
<p>As the week continues, economic data look a bit thin. However, there was some on Monday and it didnt particularly impress. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/factory-orders-100"" id=""5fc34792ba458"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""100"">Factory orders</a></span> fell 0.6% in November, when a consensus of analysts by Briefing.com had predicted a 0.3% rise. On the plus side, November <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/durable-goods-orders-86"" id=""5fc34792ba4f1"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""86"">durable goods orders</a></span> rose 0.7% after falling a dramatic 4.3% in October. Still, Briefing.com expressed concern that factory orders for December might also have been weak considering the big market sell-off that month and worries then about a government shutdown (which ended up taking place and lasting well into January).</p>
<h3><strong>Tuning In Tonight For Possible Shutdown Update</strong></h3>
<p>Its not too soon, maybe, to start thinking about possible impacts if theres a second government shutdown. We have 10 days until the deadline, and President Trump makes his delayed State of the Union speech tonight. It wouldnt be unheard of for the market to move based in part on a State of the Union, especially when you consider the possible ramifications on the economy if it looks like an immigration compromise might not be reached.</p>
<p>Turning back to data, Monday saw the release of Januarys Investor Movement Index? (IMXSM), which fell for a fourth-straight month to its lowest level since July 2012. The IMXwhich measures what TD Ameritrade clients are actually doing and their exposure level to marketsappeared to reflect some ambiguity surrounding U.S.- China trade relations keeping investors in more defensive parts of the market.</p>
<p>TD Ameritrade clients were once again net buyers during January. However, buying among equities was light, with clients gravitating toward less risky assets, including fixed-income products. This activity, along with decreasing relative volatility among widely held securities, including General Electric (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/general-electric"" id=""5fc34792b991c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8193"">GE</a></span>) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/microsoft-corp"" id=""5fc34792b99c9"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""252"">MSFT</a></span>), helped push the IMX score lower.</p>
<h3><strong>VIX Below 16</strong></h3>
<p>Sixteen can be a meaningful number. For some, it might bring memories of birthday parties, or getting a drivers license and barreling off in the family station wagon.</p>
<p>There was also special meaning in 16 for the stock market Monday, as the most well known fear indicator, the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/volatility-s-p-500"" id=""5fc34792b9a87"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""44336"">VIX</a></span>, closed below that level for the first time since early November. A lower VIX, which in Mondays case corresponded with both a <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/us-spx-500"" id=""5fc34792b9b2c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""166"">S&amp;P 500</a></span> rally and the Feds recent more dovish stance, potentially might indicate less choppy action in the near future. It also could hint at investors maybe getting more willing to embrace cyclical sectors as fear retreats.</p>
<p>While theres no guarantee of this happening, the fall below 16 is a 180 from just over a month ago, when VIX rose above 36 during the Christmas Eve sell-off. That was the highest level since February of last year. VIX has fallen pretty steadily since Dec. 24, and is back near its historic average in the 15 handle.</p>
<p>Often, but not always, a lower VIX can mean a less risk-averse investor mood. A market like Decemberswhen major indices seemed to go up or down (more often down) 2% every sessioncan have some investors looking for risk-off places to put their money. While theres no risk-free investment, a high VIX means investors often tend to gravitate toward some of the bond-like sectors such as utilities, or simply pull money out of stocks and put it in fixed income or gold. Utilities and health care were among the leading sectors in December when VIX was soaring. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc34792b9bc7"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">Gold</a></span> also rose sharply.</p>
<p>Contrast that with Monday, when info tech easily topped the leaderboard with a 1.6% gain. Accompanying that were solid performances in other so-called risk-on sectors like industrials and communication services. Defense sector stocks and some of the FAANGs, including Netflix (NFLX), performed particularly well. At the same time, health care and utilities were down near the bottom of the performance ladder.</p>
<p>Some of the stocks that climbed Monday included ones that were beaten up the most last year amid higher fear levels, including Apple (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/apple-computer-inc"" id=""5fc34792b9c66"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""6408"">AAPL</a></span>), Boeing (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/boeing-co"" id=""5fc34792b9d06"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""238"">BA</a></span>) and Facebook (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/facebook-inc"" id=""5fc34792b9da6"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""26490"">FB</a></span>). Lockheed Martin (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/lockheed-martin"" id=""5fc34792b9e48"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""7880"">LMT</a></span>) and Microsoft (MSFT) were also among the big gainers. People sometimes underrate how psychologically what AAPL means to the market. When its shares fell to 52-week lows, that appeared to cause some investors to decide it was time to come back into the marketand not just into AAPL. Some other beaten-down stocks that also exert influence (though maybe not to the same extent as AAPL) include General Electric (GE) and Ford (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/ford-motor-co"" id=""5fc34792b9eee"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""255"">F</a></span>).</p>
<p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picb262ba2c0b3f5864ad70cae9209e4096.jpg"" alt=""CBOE Volatility Index"" title=""CBOE Volatility Index"" border=""0"" align=""bottom""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">CBOE Volatility Index</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p><em>Figure 1:WHAT A DIFFERENCE A MONTH MAKES. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) finished 2018 with a 25-handle, down a bit from the Christmas Eve stock market selloff, but quite a bit higher than where it finished Monday at 15.7. The term structure of the fear index has been altered as well. Note the shift in the futures (/VX) curve from the beginning of the year (yellow line) to Monday (red line) has gone from steep backwardation (near-term futures higher than deferred months) to contango, with lower prices in the near-term futures contracts.

<p><b>Revisiting FAANGs: </b>Anyone who wrote off the FAANGs after last years swoon might be having second thoughts now as the five names (combined) are slightly outpacing the S&amp;P 500 (SPX) year-to-date. FAANG names combined were up more than 9% in 2019 as the week began despite what might be best described as a mixed earnings season for the closely watched stocks. While investors seemed to greet Facebook (FB) and Apple (AAPL) earnings with elation, they didnt appear so wild about what they heard from Amazon (NASDAQ:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/amazon-com-inc"" id=""5fc34792b9f94"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""6435"">AMZN</a></span>), GOOG, or Netflix (NFLX), at least judging from how the stocks performed after company financial data hit the news.</p>
<p>What remains to be seen is whether the FAANGs can start to recover some of the excitement that helped make them momentum drivers of the 2016-2018 market rally. The FAANG stock recovery early this year occurs as the overall market also appears to be in recovery mode, but whats not so clear is whether FAANGs are simply rising as part of a tide that lifts all boats or if theyre in the vanguard. Considering the various issues that now divide the FAANGsprivacy, user growth, China trade, advertising demandit could be difficult to see them trading once again as a solid block leading the market higher (or lower).</p>
<p><b>Cool Beans? </b>Amid the wrangling over trade tensions with China, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34792ba034"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span> might be a key ingredient. Though China recently re-entered the U.S. soy market, agreeing to buy 5 million tons of the oilseed, it's still a drop in the bushel compared to its purchases in prior years. And according to Jim Collins, head of DowDupont's (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/du-pont"" id=""5fc34792ba0da"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""7981"">DWDP</a></span>) agricultural division, farmers might still be unconvinced in the soybean's return to export prominence. Though many farmers are holding off in making final planting decisions, early signs still point to a downshift in soy plantings in favor of corn, and to perhaps a lesser degree <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc34792ba184"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">wheat</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-cotton-no.2"" id=""5fc34792ba22b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8851"">cotton</a></span>, Collins says. Agribusiness firms such as DWDP typically get a first-hand view as sales of fertilizer and seed, purchased at the start of the growing season, might offer clues into planting preferences.</p>
<p><b>Tech Talk: </b>Looking for a moment at the technical underbelly of the market, the S&amp;P 500 Index (SPX) has left the 50-day moving average far behind and for the first time in a while has the 200-day moving average back in sight. Last month, the index bounded past the 50-day average (now near 2609) and then faltered and tested it. That support appeared to hold, and the SPX is now above 2700 for the first time since early December. The 200-day moving average is a moving target, of course, and is down from where it stood back a month or two ago. As of Monday, it rested at 2741, just 17 points from where the SPX closed. While the 200-day moving average seemed to represent solid support for much of last year before the autumn sell-off, according to many Wall Street analysts, it could now form a resistance point. Sometimesbut not alwaysmarket momentum can pick up when a major index takes out some of the moving averages. The 100-day moving average of 2709 is another one investors might want to consider monitoring. Even if you dont trade the technicals, getting familiar with these levels can sometimes help an investor better decipher the markets behavior.</p>

<h3><strong>Technical Analysis &amp; WHEAT/RUB: 2019-05-15</strong></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Sowing wheat in the US is behind schedule</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In this review we suggest to consider the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc3481754580"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">WHEAT</a></span>/<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-rub"" id=""5fc3481754791"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""2186"">RUB</a></span> Personal Composite Instrument(PCI). It reflects the price dynamics of wheat versus Russian ruble. Is the growth of WHEAT/RUB quotations possible?</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It rises when wheat becomes more expensive on the world market and the Russian currency weakens. The fall of the ruble exchange rate may cause an increase in purchases of foreign currency by the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation. In accordance with the fiscal rule, the Ministry of Finance of Russian acquires currency for budget revenues from the sale price of Russian oil over $40 per barrel. From May 14, 2019 to June 6, ministry will purchase US dollars amounted 16.7 billion rubles ($ 256 million) per day. This is noticeably more than the volume in the previous period, which amounted to 11.6 billion rubles per day. An additional negative factor for the ruble may be the Russian Central Bank's plans to lower the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/interest-rate-decision-554"" id=""5fc34817554ea"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""554"">key rate</a></span>. It is equal to 7.75% with inflation of 5.2%. In turn, wheat has risen in price due to a report that the sowing company is lagging behind the schedule in the Midwestern United States. Russia is going to reduce wheat exports in the agricultural season 2019/20 to 36 million tons, compared with 37 million tons in the 2018/19 season. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) expects a reduction in the grain harvest in Ukraine by 5.6% to 65.3 million tons in 2019.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">On the daily timeframe, WHEAT/RUB: D1 exceeded the resistance line of the downward trend. Various technical analysis indicators generated uptrend signal. Further growth of quotations is possible in case of an increase in demand and a reduction in world yield.</p>

After opening the pending order, we shall move the stop to the next fractal low following the Bollinger and Parabolic signals to the next fractal minimum. Thus, we are changing the potential profit/loss to the breakeven point. More risk-averse traders may switch to the 4-hour chart after the trade and place there a stop loss moving it in the direction of the trade. If the price meets the stop level (371) without reaching the order (390), we recommend to close the position: the market sustains internal changes that were not taken into account.</p>

The S&amp;P 500 erased all of its 2011 losses and is now on course for the best monthly performance since 1974. Commodities meanwhile also took another major step away from the lows seen last month with the Reuters Jeffries CRB index surging by 5.5 percent and almost moving into positive territory for the year.<br><br>The big question now is whether Europe has done enough in order to bring back investor confidence in the Eurozone or whether, once the dust settles, the market once again comes to the conclusion that the can has once again been kicked further into the long grass. While stock markets rallied Eurozone bond markets seemed less convinced with the 10 year yield on Spanish and Italian bonds falling by much less than what could have been hoped for. These markets will be the focus in the weeks ahead and will determine whether the rally in stocks and commodities will continue.<br><br>All in all a good week though, especially for riskier assets which on top of the European result took direction from improved economic data from the US and China which has further reduced the risk of recession. This changed environment forced many investors and funds to re-enter on the long side thereby adding additional upside pressure to the market. According to Barclays, investors globally pulled 10 billion dollars out of commodities during September with speculative investments held by hedge funds through futures and options on U.S. exchanges falling by 44 percent to 900,000 lots. Rebuilding these positions has been felt across all commodities this week, especially in copper, silver and WTI crude.<br><br><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img src=""http://www.tradingfloor.com/Blogs/commodity-weekly/PublishingImages/10-11/27_CRB.bmp"" border=""0""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText""></span></div></div></div><br><br>Copper goes berserk<br>The highflier has undoubtedly been copper with its 20 percent rally in just one week, the biggest weekly gain since at least 1986. Much of the recessionary fears during September were expressed through copper after hedge funds turned outright bearish on the metal for the first time since October 2009. The changed environment following better economic data and a weaker dollar triggered a major scramble to cover shorts and rebuild long positions thereby giving prices a dramatic boost. Further support has come from China as demand has returned after imports rose to a 16 month high in September, combined with falling supply due to labour unrest at mines in Peru and Indonesia.<br><br>Iron ore tells a different story<br>Iron ore however continues to tell a different story after the price has dropped by one third since early September on weakness in global steel markets. Unlike copper Chinese demand for iron ore has been slowing and with miners in Australia and Brazil continuing to produce at full capacity the market has been flooded and prices have suffered as a consequence. Prices are still more than double the big miners production costs so further losses are likely if demand does not pick up soon.<br><br>U.S. crude gaining on Brent crude<br>The price of prompt WTI crude has broken above previous resistance after a 21 percent rally since early October. The rally has primarily benefitted the front end of the oil curve with the price of oil for December delivery surging above previous resistance at 91 dollars per barrel. The change in the shape of the forward curve over the last seven days has been quite dramatic resulting in the spread between current month and next month turning positive for the first time since September 2008.<br><br>In the process the discount to Brent crude has begun to shrink moving from a recent high of 25 dollars down to 18.50 dollars as the recovery in North Sea production and increase in Libyan crude production continues to ease the tightness seen in European crude markets over the summer.<br><br><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img src=""http://www.tradingfloor.com/Blogs/commodity-weekly/PublishingImages/10-11/28_cl.bmp"" border=""0""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText""></span></div></div></div><br><br>After the initial spike higher oil prices however failed to move further ahead after the European debt announcement, probably highlighting a belief that much higher prices from here are not supported by fundamentals. WTI crude has now moved from a negative to a neutral stance after the move above 91 and technically could be targeting the 100 to 105 area over the coming weeks although we find limited value above 95 dollars for now. <br><br>Gold broken the 1,700 dollar shackle<br>Investors in gold finally seem to have recovered from the sharp correction witnessed during September as gold took out resistance at 1,700 dollars before reaching a five-week high. With the safe haven aspect of gold investment currently not the focus it will be difficult to make much further progress beyond 1,772 for now. Not least because strong equity markets and a falling dollar have been the main drivers behind the recent rally and some risk of profit taking in these markets now looks increasingly likely over the coming week. <br><br><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img src=""http://www.tradingfloor.com/Blogs/commodity-weekly/PublishingImages/10-11/28_gold.bmp"" border=""0""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText""></span></div></div></div><br><br>Silver and platinum back to life as industrial metals shine<br>Both silver and platinum experienced a reversal of fortunes this week both outperforming gold as they, just like copper, reacted to improved economic data which points toward improved demand for industrial metals. During the last couple of months hedge funds have reduced their long exposure to the lowest level in 30 months and the rebuilding of positions has been a factor behind the rally and further improvements on the economic front are required for the outperformance to continue.<br><br>Thai flood removes global rice glut<br>The worst flood to hit Thailand in more than 50 years has the potential of wiping out between 15 and 20 percent of the countrys main rice harvest, which represents about 70 percent of annual production. The impact on global prices has been felt over the last few weeks especially considering its role as the worlds biggest rice exporter. Rice is Asias leading food crop and the worlds most widely consumed staple food and a further deterioration carries the risk of spilling over into higher food inflation at a time where inflation had just begun to come under control among emerging economies.<br><br>Earlier this month the United States Department of Agriculture projected a global rice surplus of nearly 4 million tonnes but the flood now carries the risk of removing this glut thereby adding to the upside pressure on prices. US production was already suffering after farmers had a torrid summer with an early flood being followed by a drought, thereby reducing the crop by almost one third.<br><br>All however is not lost as Thailand could replant once the flood recedes and India could ramp up its rice exports. But until further news about potential crop destruction reaches us the price of rough rice for January delivery, traded in Chicago, carries the risk of moving higher as it prices in this increased uncertainty.        <div class=""clear""></div>"

<p>Why? Because the Trump administration has decided to withhold from the public a key component of the agreement that lists specifics of what and when China will buy in terms of U.S. agriculture.</p>
<p>Releasing details of such purchase specifics could influence market behavior, argued U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin in a joint statement issued Tuesday.</p>
<p></p><h2 dir=""ltr"">Other Than Dollar Value, Little Clue For Grains Traders</h2>
<p>What this basically means is that the 86-page document to be released after Wednesdays signing will not tell traders how to exactly position their bets on soybeans and corn, in anticipation of Chinas purchases of the two U.S. grains for animal feed and other uses. <br><br>Whats more, caution may be necessary on the part of traders, because Messrs Lighthizer and Mnuchin said on Tuesday <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/news/stock-market-news/us-to-maintain-tariffs-on-chinese-goods-until-phase-2-deal-mnuchin-2059574"" id=""5fc348bc89462"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""oal"" data-articleid=""2059574"">that none</a></span> of the U.S. duties applied on Chinese goods over the past 18 months will be removed despite the deal. The tariffed amount stands at more than $360 billion.<br><br>This basically means that aside from the dollar value printed on the document for purchases, it is pretty much up to China to decide how it wishes to proceed with its U.S. farm buys.</p>
<p>While there may be a deal that officials on both sides are privy to, the traders would have no advance knowledge of the details until they see the numbers reflected in belated data released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture  or get them leaked by sources in the right places.</p>
<h2 dir=""ltr"">Even With Deal, Trade War Not Over</h2><p></p>
<p>Even more important, traders have to beware that for all intent and purposes, the trade war is far from over  proving precisely what Taoran Notes, a blog linked to Chinas state-run Economic Daily newspaper,  said.</p>
<p>Beijing has described the Phase One as just the first round of a game through that social media account, </p>
<p>We must bear in mind that the trade war is not over yet C the U.S. hasnt revoked all its tariffs on China, and China is still implementing its retaliatory measures, said the Taoran Notes, which is used by the Chinese government to manage trade talk expectations. There are still many uncertainties down the road.</p>
<p>Phillip Streible, chief markets strategist at Blue Line Futures in Chicago, concurs. Reports that Chinese tariffs are to stay on until after the U.S. election despite a trade deal, would merit further caution on the part of traders.</p>
<p></p><h2 dir=""ltr"">Buyers Beware</h2>
<p>Both U.S. and Chinese officials agree that to make the Phase One work, a Phase Two is integral. But reaching consensus on what is likely to be an even more vexatious round of talks seems daunting to each side, with President Donald Trump even suggesting that it be put off till after the presidential election in November.<br><br>So, back to the question of where this leaves soybeans and corn  as well as wheat, which, however, isnt a major Chinese import.<br><br>Some analysts say U.S. grain prices have trended flat or higher since the start of this year in anticipation of better demand from China after the Phase One deal.<br><br></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img title=""U.S. Soybeans Futures Weekly Prices"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pice2b4d6e0a4c0a2dbeb926cb05057fe86.png"" alt=""U.S. Soybeans Futures Weekly Prices""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">U.S. Soybeans Futures Weekly Prices</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr"">Some Still See Phase One As Catalyst For A Grains Rally</h2><p></p>
<p>The trade agreement is a likely catalyst and could have big implications for corn, said Eric Scoles, commodities strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago.  </p>
<p></p><p>He said the bigger factor driving corn now was demand. If the U.S.-China trade deal moves forward there is huge potential for increased demand for corn; whether its for livestock feed, human consumption or production of ethanol.<br><br></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img title=""U.S. Corn Futures Weekly Prices"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic05d881a0cf47bfe8f2a699bede9775be.png"" alt=""U.S. Corn Futures Weekly Prices""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">U.S. Corn Futures Weekly Prices</span></div></div></div><p></p><p></p>

<h2><strong>Energy</strong></h2>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc347cdccd37"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">Crude Oil</a></span></strong> is on track to advance for a sixth day out of the last seven, touching the highest since November 13 yesterday, after OPEC and its allies announced at the weekend its determination to follow through with production cuts until at least June, and possibly to the end of the year.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia has reportedly pledged bigger-than-needed cuts in shipments next month, while Russia said it also intends to speed up its progressive reductions. While rising U.S. production is mitigating the loss of production from Venezuela and Iran sanctions to some extent, OPEC cutbacks appear to be winning the fight at the moment, as West Texas Intermediate is now up 40% from the December low of $42.20.</p>
<p>The 55-day moving average crossed above the 100-day moving average earlier today for the first time since November 7, and this is often interpreted as a longer-term bullish signal. Speculative non-commercial traders are most bullish on oil prices since the week of November 20, after increasing net long positions for a fourth straight week in the week to March 12, CFTC data shows.</p>

<p>Speculative investors reduced their net short positions in <strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/natural-gas"" id=""5fc347cdccdec"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8862"">Natural Gas</a></span></strong> for the first time in five weeks in the week to March 12, according to the latest data snapshot from CFTC. Some profit-taking probably took place as gas prices fell for the first time in five weeks last week. Prices rebounded yesterday and are currently at 2.839, edging toward the 55-day moving average at 2.9056.</p>
<p>Reflecting the lower prices seen since December, the cost of Japans LNG imports fell 0.5% from a month earlier in February, the first monthly decline since October 2017, according to preliminary data from the Ministry of Finance. The planned start of gas shipments from Israel to Egypt have been delayed until at least mid-year due to pipeline issues.</p>
<h2><strong>Precious metals</strong></h2>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc347cdcce9c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">Gold</a></span></strong> looks set to post its third weekly gain in a row as the U.S. dollar retreats ahead of the FOMC meeting. The metal has once again recouped the $1,300 handle, and is currently at $1,306.07 with the 50% retracement of the February 20 to March 5 drop sitting at $1,313.99.</p>
<p>Speculative accounts reduced their net long positions for a third straight week to March 12, CFTC data shows, as investors lost patience with the lack of upward progress for the precious metal. Net longs are now at the lowest since the week of January 22.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/silver"" id=""5fc347cdccf50"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8836"">Silver</a></span></strong> is consolidating the push above the 200-day moving average earlier this month, and is poised for its third consecutive daily gain. The 100-day moving average has moved above the 200-day moving average for the first time since February last year.</p>
<p>Speculative investors scaled back their net long positions to the lowest this year, but exchange-traded funds added 3.6 million troy ounces to their holdings last Friday, the biggest one-day increase since November 13, according to Bloomberg reports.</p>
<p>The gold/silver (Mint) ratio is marginally lower on the week, but has held above the 100-day moving average on a closing basis so far this month.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/platinum"" id=""5fc347cdccffc"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8910"">Platinum</a></span></strong> is in the process of recouping lost ground from the fall two weeks ago which stalled at the 55-day moving average support at 818.63. Despite the rebound, speculative investors were net sellers for the first time in four weeks amid some profit-taking.</p>
<p>There was some good news on the supply front as a South African court said Friday that a plan by the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) to widen a strike at one mine over a wage dispute to other mines would be illegal.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/palladium"" id=""5fc347cdcd0a1"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8883"">Palladium</a></span></strong> has continued its push to record highs again this week, though speculative investors have been booking some profits on the way up, reducing positions for a second straight week, according to the latest data from CFTC. Net long positions have now fallen to the lowest since the week of October 30.</p>
<p>The palladium/platinum spread has widened to a record level as platinum fails to match palladiums advance. Palladium is now at 1,580.98 and platinum at 837.19.</p>

<h2><strong>Base metals</strong></h2>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/copper"" id=""5fc347cdcd146"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8831"">Copper</a></span></strong> is trading in the middle of a two-week range with investors mostly sidelined, for now. In a Bloomberg survey conducted last week, the majority of copper traders were neutral on the metal, highlighting that it was capped by a weakening macro outlook yet supported by tight fundamentals. The industrial metal shrugged off Chinas decision to cut VAT rates from April 1, though prices were marked lower in a knee-jerk reaction to the news at the time.</p>
<p>Chinas copper production rose 6.3% from a year earlier in the January-February period to 1.34 million tons, despite the Lunar New Year holidays, according to data published by the National Bureau of Statistics yesterday. LME copper inventories jumped to a five-month high on Friday, posting the biggest one-day increase since November amid inflows from Asia.</p>
<h2><strong>Agriculturals</strong></h2>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc347cdcd1f5"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">Wheat</a></span></strong> recorded its biggest weekly gain since July last week as uncertainty about future U.S. harvests surfaced after the Great Plains growing area in the U.S. was blanketed by snow and subjected to high winds. Russias wheat exports in the current season since July 1 are up 3% y/y so far, according to tentative data reported by Russias grain agency.</p>
<p>Speculative investors reduced net long positions for the first time in four weeks to March 12, after reaching the most extreme levels since January 2018, according to the latest data released by CFTC. Wheat is now at 4.526 after rebounding from 14-month lows last week.</p>

<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc347cdcd286"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">Soybeans</a></span></strong> survived a test of the 200-day moving average support at 8.787 early last week to post a higher weekly close for the first time in three weeks. Fears of supply constraints helped the rebound as rains in Brazil restricted consignments to ports, while a strong domestic currency persuaded Argentinian farmers not to send their crops to the international market. Separately, Brazil reported that its soy harvest was 61.8% complete as of last Friday.</p>
<p>Speculative investors remain skeptical about the rally however, as they increased their net short bets to the most since the week of September 18, the latest data shows. Soybean prices are now at 8.939 and seem to be struggling to overcome the 55-week moving average, which is at 9.1123 today. That moving average has capped prices since the week of June 4 last year.</p>
<p>The prospect of reduced supply going forward has prompted a rebound in<strong> <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-sugar-no11"" id=""5fc347cdcd333"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8869"">Sugar</a></span></strong> prices over the past 10 days. Beet planting in Europe is seen falling 5% to 1.55 million hectares, the most in four years, amid a supply glut that has worsened over the past two years, according to a French growers association. In addition, reports of adverse weather conditions in Brazil has heightened concerns about the next harvest.</p>
<p>Before the sharp rebound, speculative accounts were the most bearish on sugar in five months, according to the latest data snapshot from CFTC. Sugar closed at 0.12898, the highest since February 27, and is testing resistance at the 100-week moving average of 0.1288.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc347cdcd3dd"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">Corn</a></span></strong> had its biggest weekly jump since October last week as it snapped a two-week losing streak. Speculative investors are still bearish on the commodity, being net sellers for a fifth straight week to January 12 and boosting net short positions to the most since November 2017. Corn is now at 3.633 with the 100-day moving average at 3.6585.</p>

From <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc347638e8a3"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">oil</a></span> to <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/orange-juice"" id=""5fc347638eb6f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8891"">orange juice</a></span> prices, the surprising catalysts kept coming, with more likely till the closing bell on December 31.</p>
<p>Dominick Chirichella of New Yorks Energy Management Institute, whos witnessed almost all there is to be seen in the oil market over the past four decades, couldnt have said it better when he wrote, a week ago, in his final analysis for the year that the end of 2018 could not be more different than the end of 2017.</p>
<p>Just the sheer divergence in the performance of commodities over the past two years would be adequate to support that thesis.</p>
<h3><strong>Big Oil And Metals Losses, Huge Gas Swings</strong></h3>
<p>In 2017, US crude ended up 13 percent, with the biggest daily move no more than 3 percent, despite the market retrenching from the first ever shale-engineered oil oversupply. This year, with a less pronounced, shale glut '2.0', the market is looking at a 40 percent loss after overseeing the worst bearish streak in history: an uninterrupted 12-day selloff.</p>
<p>But oils volatility into the year-end has just been as intense, with 7-percent down days versus 9-percent up days that could keep traders in suspense till the final session.</p>
<p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picdd492ceeacfc58dec2bfc6c4aefe3ece.jpeg"" alt=""NatGas Weekly Chart"" title=""NatGas Weekly Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">NatGas Weekly Chart</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p>Speaking of volatility, nothing could compare to this year's 18 percent move for <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/natural-gas"" id=""5fc347638ec26"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8862"">natural gas</a></span> during a single daythree times more than its 2017 peak. The gyrations deprived gas of the commodities performance crown for 2018, pushing it to third place behind <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-cocoa"" id=""5fc347638eccb"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8894"">cocoa</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc347638ed75"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">wheat</a></span> as of this writing, despite low winter reserves for the fuel. Annual gains, which stood as high as 60 percent a month ago, have fallen to just around 16 percent.</p>
<p>The story in metals is just as extraordinary. In a rare phenomenon, the futures of nearly every traded base metal in London and New York are set to finish the year with double-digit losses despite top commodities buyer China putting on hold its tariffs battle with the United States, amid expectations of an imminent deal between the two economic superpowers. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/copper"" id=""5fc347638ee2a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8831"">Copper</a></span>, which heads the global metals complex, is down 17 percent while <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/zinc?cid=956470"" id=""5fc347638eee0"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""956470"">zinc</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/lead?cid=959207"" id=""5fc347638ef8d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""959207"">lead</a></span> both saw losses in excess of 20 percent.</p>
<p>On the agricultural front, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc347638f02a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span> are also nearing double-digit losses, defying optimism springing from the same US-Sino <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/analysis/not-a-great-christmas-for-soy-farmers-despite-trumps-efforts-200370891"" id=""5fc347638ff0d"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""pal"" data-articleid=""200370891"">trade truce</a></span>, after prohibitive duties earlier in the year that stifled sales of American-origin soy to China.</p>

<h3><strong>Bizarre Actors Distort The Script</strong></h3>
<p>But the commodities tale for 2018 was more than just price action. It also involved bizarre actors who should never have been part of the script.</p>
<p>Everyone knows US President Donald Trump loves to tweet about immigration, trade, climate change and even White House sackings. But no one expected his passion for 140-character-long text bursts to upend an oil market that had just recovered from one of its worst supply gluts ever.</p>
<p>The @realDonaldTrump Twitter handle made its debut in the oil market in the spring, right after the president canceled an Obama-era US nuclear accord with Iran and threatened to place sanctions on crude exports from Tehran. When crude prices shot up as a result of feared supply tightness from the sanctions, Trump lashed out via tweet, demanding more oil from Saudi Arabia and other suppliers in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). At stake was the upcoming US midterm election in November, and possible voter anger against Trump and his Republican party if oil prices remained high.</p>
<p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picc30f1f551ae54b8ecbd47da047be91d3.jpeg"" alt=""WTI Weekly Chart"" title=""WTI Weekly Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">WTI Weekly Chart</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p>After the enlarged OPEC+ group, including Russia, turned their spigots on in full, the president issued unexpected waivers on Iranian oil exports that, when combined with record US production, planted the seeds for yet another oversupplied market, after the 2014-2017 glut. When crude prices slumped, OPEC resolved to cut supplies but Trump again tweeted that the cartel shouldnt, pressuring the market anew.</p>
<p>If Trump was a willingalbeit oddparticipant in oil this year, even stranger was the posthumous role played by the Saudi journalist and US-resident Jamal Khashoggi, who for more than two months after his gruesome killing in early October, remained a nightmare for the Saudi Crown Prince and oil bulls everywhere. Murdered at the Saudi consulate in Turkey, Khashoggi provided Trump with just the ammunition the president needed to keep tweeting that the Kingdom and OPEC should not cut production or boost prices.</p>
<h3><strong>Current Pressure Points: Recession Fear, US Government Shutdown</strong></h3>
<p>So effective was Trumps battle against high oil prices that OPECs eventual announcement of a 1.2 million barrels-per-day cut in global supplies through June 2019 has barely lifted the market.</p>
<p>While Wednesdays freak 9 percent rally suggests the likelihood of a violent snap-back in prices once a bottom is established, fears of a global recession could also temper the recovery, analysts say. For now, the partial US government shutdownover Trumps demands that his Democratic rivals in Congress approve $5 billion in funds to build a wall he claims will shut out Mexican illegalscould keep the market on tenterhooks.</p>
<p>Trump wasnt the only politician who had an outsized impact on commodity prices this year.</p>
<p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picbcb4e85c103da37a2cb16696eab2c30a.jpeg"" alt=""Soybeans Weekly Chart"" title=""Soybeans Weekly Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Soybeans Weekly Chart</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p>By engaging in a tit-for-tat tariffs battle with Trump, Chinese President Xi Jinping also contributed to the rout in prices of copper and soybeanstwo of Chinas largest imports from the United States.</p>
<p>Brazilian President Javier Bolsonaro was, meanwhile, responsible for a two-month rally earlier in the year in raw <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-sugar-no11"" id=""5fc347638f0d2"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8869"">sugar</a></span>, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/arabica-coffee-4-5"" id=""5fc347638f175"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""964526"">arabica coffee</a></span> and orange juiceall three major exports for the Latin American country -- as speculators bet on success for his reformist election promises.

Yet, these factors alone arent expected to push <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc347498f322"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">crude</a></span> prices into a sustained rally before year end, with traders likely to wait out 2019 demand data before taking any action. Fears of a global slowdown and skepticism over US-China ties could also cap activity in oil.</p>
<p>The story could be a little different for <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc347498f54c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">gold</a></span>, which faces a pivotal week with the Federal Reserve scheduled to <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/fed-interest-rate-decision-168"" id=""5fc347498f995"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""168"">decide</a></span> on whether it should hike rates for a fourth time this year.

<p>With many betting the Fed will pause any tightening cycle after December, the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/us-dollar-index"" id=""5fc347498f5fc"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8827"">dollar</a></span> is expected to gain modestly if theres indeed a hike on Wednesday. But if the central bank stays the course, it could be a precursor to sharp weakness in the greenback in early 2019, a factor that may drive gold toward Aprils $1,300 high over the next two weeks.</p>
<h3><strong>Gold Could Be Seen As 'Savior' If Fed Stalls On Rate Hike</strong></h3>
<p>Chuck Butler, managing director of EverBank Global Markets and a Fed watcher of more than 35 years, indicated that a stalled rate hike at this juncture could add to worries of a potential recession. In an interview published on the NASDAQ site on Friday, Butler said: Things will eventually get (to look) so bad, that gold will be the savior.</p>
<p>Other than the Fed decision, investors in gold are also expected to pay particular attention to US <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/building-permits-885"" id=""5fc347498fe99"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""885"">housing data</a></span> for November on Tuesday and final <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/gdp-375"" id=""5fc347498ff6c"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""375"">Q3 economic growth</a></span> on Friday, along with <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/news/world-news/uks-hunt-says-version-of-pm-mays-deal-can-get-through-parliament-1722619"" id=""5fc3474990bbe"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""oal"" data-articleid=""1722619"">Brexit</a></span> negotiations, where Britains embattled Prime Minister Theresa May has less than four months to act on her divorce plans for the UK from the EU.</p>
<h3><strong>More Near-Term Pressure Expected In Natural Gas</strong></h3>
<p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picc22462c9f87fba7bb35012338de867c8.jpeg"" alt=""Natural Gas 5-Hour Chart"" title=""Natural Gas 5-Hour Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Natural Gas 5-Hour Chart</span></div></div></div><p></p>

Just over a month ago, natural gas was up 60 percent on the year.The sheer volatility has forced the fuel to concede its number one spot for commodities performance to <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc347498f767"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">wheat</a></span>, which is now up 24 percent on the year. (desktop users, click <a href=""/commodities/real-time-futures"">here</a> and go to performance to see all commodity returns for 2018).</p>
<p>Dan Myers of Gelber &amp; Associates, an energy markets advisory in Houston, Texas, said gas prices have been pummeled by weaker demand for pre-winter heating lately. In a note issued on Friday, he added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Milder weather will hamper demand next week and put into question the strength of withdrawals in late-December.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crude prices, meanwhile, briefly bucked their lower trend last week, rising as much as 3% in Thursdays session on a Bloomberg report that Saudi Arabia plans to slash exports to the United States in the coming weeks, in an effort to dampen visible build-ups in <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/crude-oil-inventories-75"" id=""5fc347499002c"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""75"">crude inventories</a></span>. Saudi crude shipments to the US next month could even test the 30-year low of 582,000 barrels a day set in late 2017, down about 40 percent from the most recent three-month average, the report said.</p>
<p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picc038cdeb9e28a4a9c165f1668f145280.jpeg"" alt=""WTI 5-Hour Chart"" title=""WTI 5-Hour Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">WTI 5-Hour Chart</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p>Within 24 hours, crude prices gave back all of that rally. With just over two weeks to the end of 2018, US West Texas Intermediate crude remains down about 15% on the year and some 32% lower from its four-year highs of nearly $77 per barrel hit in early October. UK-traded <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/brent-oil"" id=""5fc347498f80f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8833"">Brent</a></span>, the global benchmark for oil, is down about 10% on the year and nearly 32% lower from four-year highs of nearly $87 per barrel, hit two months ago.</p>
<h3><strong>US-Focused Saudi Oil Cuts Not An Immediate Game-Changer</strong></h3>
<p>Dominick Chirichella of the Energy Management Institute in New York said although Saudi Arabias US-focused cuts on crude supply were as bullish a factor to oil as any, they werent an immediate game-changer due to worries about a global economic slowdown in 2019, along with anxiety that the US-China trade truce may only consist of symbolic victories rather than any actual progress.</p>
<p>In a note issued at the weekend, Chirichella acknowledged the Saudi production cuts reported by Bloomberg could be the beginning of a new uptrend. He, however, added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am not ready to jump into the bullish waters right now. I am maintaining my overall oil view and short-term bias at neutral as we see how the new OPEC accord plays out in the early stages.</p>

<p><strong>CRUDE OIL</strong> surged to the highest since October 31 yesterday as US President Trump announced that the waivers on Iran sanctions granted to eight oil-importing countries would cease when they expire early next month. Yesterdays rally of more than 2.5% was the biggest one-day move since January 9. Prices are now comfortably above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the October-December decline at $63.89. The 78.6% retracement of the same drop is at $69.75.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, Saudi Arabia has announced it is ready to increase production to ease the shortfall once the waivers end. Higher oil prices has had an impact on the heavy oil importers in Asia, with their currencies and stock markets weakening (India, Japan, China etc.) while producers such as Malaysia and Indonesia have seen their currencies benefit.</p>
<p>Ahead of yesterdays rally, speculative investors trimmed their net long oil futures positions for the first time in nine weeks up to April 16. The Brent/WTI spread has widened to almost nine points, the widest in three weeks.</p>

<p><strong>NATURAL GAS</strong> prices are stuck near 2-1/2 year lows and are facing a fifth consecutive month of losses, the longest monthly losing streak since late-2008/early-2009. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/natural-gas"" id=""5fc347f32d477"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8862"">Natural gas</a></span> snapped a seven-day losing streak yesterday as forecasts of cooler weather hitting northern US over the next week lent some support at these low levels. The 55-day moving average at 2.7146 has capped prices since December 24.</p>
<h3><strong>Precious metals</strong></h3>
<p><strong>GOLD</strong>s four-week decline stalled on Friday just above the key 1,270 level and the precious metal has traded mixed so far this week. Strong earnings reports on Wall Street has kept risk appetite alive and hence <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc347f32d52b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">gold</a></span> is feeling a bit of pressure. Speculative investors reduced net long positions in the week to April 16, according to the latest <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-gold-speculative-net-positions-1618"" id=""5fc347f32dc1b"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1618"">CFTC</a></span> data, and they are now at the lowest since the week of December 4.</p>
<p><strong>SILVER </strong>closing <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/silver"" id=""5fc347f32d5e3"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8836"">prices</a></span> over the past week have been little changed, though with a gradual upward drift from 14.976 to 15.019. Speculative accounts reduced net long positions for a third straight week in the week to April 16 and they are now at the lowest since December 4.</p>
<p>The gold/silver (Mint) ratio is at 84.936, hovering above the 55-day moving average at 84.68 which has supported prices on a closing basis since February 26.</p>
<p><strong>PLATINUM</strong> has spent the last two weeks consolidating the strong upward move in March/April, which saw <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/platinum"" id=""5fc347f32d695"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8910"">prices</a></span> climb to a 10-month high. The lack of upward progress has seen speculative accounts reducing net long positions. They trimmed net longs from the highest level in more than a year in the week to April 16, the latest data snapshot from CFTC shows.</p>
<p>There was some good news on the supply front as a five-month-old strike at a mine in South Africa, which cut production by 110,000 ounces, has been resolved, according to Bloomberg reports. Platinum mining companies in the country are now preparing for a round of wage negotiations with the unions.</p>
<p><strong>PALLADIUM</strong> continues to grapple with the 100-day moving average at 1,387.62 as it consolidates the steep drop from record <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/palladium"" id=""5fc347f32d73a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8883"">highs</a></span> reached in March. The 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the March/April drop is at 1,437.41, close to yesterdays peak of 1,432.60. The retreat from record highs has seen speculative investors trimming net long positions. They have scaled back net longs for the past eight weeks, and they are now at the lowest since the week of September 18.</p>

<p><strong>COPPER</strong> prices fell Friday and Monday, retreating from the 10-month highs struck on Thursday, but still remain supported by hopes for a May breakthrough in the US-China trade negotiations.

<p dir=""ltr"">The bullish momentum may develop in case OATS exceed their last high at 281.5. This level may serve as an entry point. The initial stop loss may be placed below the two last fractal lows, the lower Bollinger band, the 200-day moving average line and the Parabolic signal at 258.5. After opening the pending order, we shall move the stop to the next fractal low following the Bollinger and Parabolic signals. Thus, we are changing the potential profit/loss to the breakeven point. More risk-averse traders may switch to the 4-hour chart after the trade and place there a stop loss moving it in the direction of the trade. If the price meets the stop level (258.5) without reaching the order (281.5), we recommend to close the position: the market sustains internal changes that were not taken into account.</p>

1606632844-3312,https://www.investing.com/commodities/rough-rice-opinion/5,Dollar Mounts a Sharp Recovery as ECB Hope Falls Flat,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dollar-mounts-a-sharp-recovery-as-ecb-hope-falls-flat-109496,"By Dailyfx ForexDec 22, 2011 03:11AM ET","<h3>Dollar Mounts a Sharp Recovery as ECB Hope Falls Flat</h3><br>The exceptional volatility for the dollar and capital markets over the previous 24 hours should have surprised no one. Anticipation of the European Central Banks pseudo-stimulus program fed into the markets insatiable appetite for speculative rallies derived from government intervention. Yet, the flash of volatility that resulted from this known catalyst was not at extraordinary as the resultant lack of follow through. Despite the exceptional market reaction to the news of a massive infusion of liquidity for the European banking system, we note that the S&amp;P 500 Index (our benchmark for risk appetite) notched volume on par with the previous trading days C in other words, surprisingly light. Volatility does not guarantee trend generation and follow through, and the volume figures on the equity benchmarks (as well as Forex futures contracts, gold, Treasury futures, etc.) remind us of that fact. Without the necessary market depth to mount a full run, we may have seen the markets last and best potential opportunity to make a year-end drive pass us by.<br><br>For those embargoing fundamentals or financial headlines of any kind this week, we have just passed the allotment of the ECBs Long-Term Refinancing Operation (LTRO) facility. This program was a liquidity injection aimed at preventing a credit crunch within the European banking system. Was this an effective initiative? It is easy to right off the event as a failure because the speculative markets would completely retrace the days risk-positive response. However, that doesnt appreciate the dampening effects of thin liquidity (which work both ways C curbing optimism as well as pessimism). The 36-month lending tempers the immediate threat of European banks (an enormous segment of the global system) collapsing under a wave of debt maturing in the open of the New Year. In other words, they have put out an immediate fire; but they have not solved the underlying troubles. Buying time is an art C and becoming increasingly expensive.<br><br>What does this mean for the dollar? Shallow markets have prevented what could have been a more concerted effort to build up speculative positioning (a more probable scenario in reaction to this event just a few months ago). That, naturally, is a boon for the greenback C a safe haven for those seeking absolute liquidity. Furthermore, if risk trends are to temper into the close of the year; we would expect the same from the speculative antithesis. However, these are not the conditions in which to ignore the risk in the unexpected. If we were to weigh the scenarios for an unexpected surge in risk versus risk aversion, it is far easier to envision panic finding an easier footing than greed in these conditions. That being the case, we will keep an eye out for a critical European downgrade and keep track of the remarkably strong demand for Treasuries.<br><h3>Euro Traders See Little Relief in Banking System, Bond Yields after LTRO</h3><br>We cannot garner a fair gauge of whether the ECBs liquidity program was successful in these kind of market conditions. An optimistic slant would find that short-term need for refinancing for banks that have been drawing excessive yields has been answered and perhaps the financial institutions will be encouraged to lend to each other and the governments (buy government bonds). However, the pessimist would say that this yet another rescue effort (an overly concentrated one) that does not answer the underlying troubles. It isnt hard to interpret 523 banks asking for 489 billion euros in three-year funds as a very real sign of stress. If everything is stable and calm until the markets fill out against early next year; perhaps a sense of stability can return. On the other hand, if a AAA-rated EU country or the EFSF program is downgraded; the markets calm will certainly be disrupted. That isnt a far-fetched concern either with the ECB still buying Italian bonds on the day of a liquidity program<br><h3>Japanese Yen Losing Stability after BoJ Hold, Shirakawas Warning, Downgrade</h3><br>Some policy officials and exporters in Japan may feel any decline in the yen is a good one; but those with long-term scope and a feel for the money markets know that you want a controlled depreciation. Yesterday, the Bank of Japan maintained its policy bearings (including its asset purchasing and credit purchasing programs). However, with that announcement Governor Shirakawa gave voice to a true concern: the impact of a spreading European financial crisis to Japan (recall the 1980s and 1997). And, then there was the Tokyo-based R&amp;Is downgrade of Japan.<br><h3>British Pound Surprisingly Buoyant after BoE Signals Future Stimulus</h3><br>I didnt have high expectations for the Bank of England minutes as we know their generate lean towards wait-and-see (hoping the EU will stop the bleeding). Yet, there was something there to note: that some of the members were already starting the argument for more bond purchases early next year. The sterling has little, meaningful scheduled event risk through the rest of this wing. Watch the euro connection.<h3>New Zealand Dollar Fails to Mount Rally on Strong 3Q GDP Showing</h3><br>The New Zealand dollar has been fundamentally primed to the point that it has shown buoyancy on even the most mundane development C a benefit of a positive bearing on yield expectations when the rest of the world is cutting. However, a genuine, better-than-expected 3Q GDP reading couldnt drive the kiwi to a meaningful run. That is the power of speculative interests. Sentiment can anchor data releases and LTROs<br><h3>Swiss Franc Ready to Extend its Decline as Country Mulls Capital Curbs</h3><br>The market didnt add much volatility to the news that some policy officials are trying to push forward an agenda of capital controls and negative interest rates C which is reasonable enough as the Parliament shot them down. Enacting rules aimed at stymieing banking interest in a banking economy is difficult to sell. However, if the Swiss want to push their currency down when the threat of mass panic is high, the bar is set high.        <div class=""clear""></div>"

I can understand where they are coming from because they relate option pricing to how stocks are priced. Cheap stocks are seen as a good investment because they can quickly rise in price C but its not the same case with options trading.<h3>Cheap Compared To What?</h3><br>When someone says they buy cheap options they typically mean that the absolute price is low. They will buy options around $25 each for example and think they are just stealing money somehow from the market. But in reality this option below on has a 20% chance of making money at expiration.<br><br><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/1324540304_0.png"" border=""0"" alt=""VIX"" title=""VIX""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">VIX</span></div></div></div><br><br>You see they are not comparing the pricing to any historical guide or point or reference. Just because an option is priced low doesnt mean that its cheap. And likewise, just because an option is expensive doesnt mean that it a great investment either.<br><h3>How To Evaluate Option Pricing</h3><br>As you start to plan out your next options strategy, there is one main factors you should evaluate before making the trade. Again its important to have a frame of reference before you go blindly buying options all over the place that are $25 each and wasting your hard earned money.<br><h3>Implied vs. Historical Volatility</h3><br>As option traders we measure how expensive or cheap options are using a parameter called implied volatility, or IV for short. All the data point shows is what the market is pricing in for future volatility of a particular stock.<br><br>High IV is synonymous with expensive options and thus shows that there is a lot of fear in the market which is driving up prices due to increased risk. Low IV is synonymous with cheap options and shows either complacency and/or greed in the market.<br><br><br><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/1324540347_0.png"" border=""0"" alt=""Historical-Volatility1"" title=""Historical-Volatility1""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Historical-Volatility1</span></div></div></div><br><br><br>The implied volatility of the option will indicate the markets expected trading range for the stock going forward. Since historical volatility can be plotted on the charts you can see how it compares to current implied volatility levels.<br><br>Remember, this doesnt mean that the market will always do what you want it too just because the historical trends are in your favor. Its all about odds and probabilities. Over time, making the right trade and managing risk will lead to profits.<br><h3>Spend Your Time Analyzing The Stock</h3><br>The reality is that the market is going to sniff out any easy profits (always has and always will). There are big banks and large traders who have much more time and money to spend searching for these little pricing inequalities than you or I do.<br><br>I suggest you spend your precious time looking at the technical indicators and analyzing the underlying stock.&nbsp; Timing your trade properly is much easier than digging for a mispricing in the options market.        <div class=""clear""></div>"

The Thai officials are planning to sell 11mln tonnes of rice from the state reserves which is to be discussed on February 29.

Another negative factor is plans of Indonesia to enhance its rice output and to renounce rice imports. The positive is the increased demand on rice from Iran, Syria and other Middle-East states, as well as from Philippines and Nigeria. The major world producers are India, Thailand and Vietnam whose crops may suffer from El Nino. In the its previous report USDA forecasted the global rice production will amount to 470.1mln tonnes in 2015/16. This is 2% below the level of the previous season. Meanwhile, the global rice consumption will surpass its production already for the 3rd straight season. This may cut the global rice reserves by 14% compared to the previous year to 89.7mln tonnes. USDA expected the volume of global rice trading to total 42.1mln tonnes which is 2% below the last years level. The rice crops in the US are at 192.3mln hundred weights (cwt), according to the previous report. In our opinion, the rice prices may depend on the USDA forecasts highlighted in its new report on February 11.<br></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pice4053b86005d744d70c0cd4358facc74.png"" alt=""Rice Daily Chart"" title=""Rice Daily Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Rice Daily Chart</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p>On the daily chart <b>Rice:D1</b> is in downtrend and has verged its resistance. The Parabolic indicator and MACD give buy signals. RSI is neutral and below 50 but has formed the positive divergence. The Bollinger bands? are slightly contracting which may mean lower volatility. The bullish momentum may develop when the price surpasses the last fractal high and the 200-day moving average at 11.56, or in case of the fall below the second fractal low, Parabolic signal and Bollinger band at 10.68. The market will choose the direction itself. Two or more positions may be placed symmetrically: having opened one of the orders, the second may be deleted as the market has chosen the direction. Having opened the pending order we shall move the stop to the next fractal high (short position) or fractal low (long position) following the Parabolic signal every 4 hours. The most risk-averse traders may switch to the 4-hour chart after the trade and place there a stop-loss moving it in the direction of the trade. Thus, we are changing the probable profit/loss ratio to the breakeven point. If the price meets the stop-loss level without reaching the order, we recommend cancelling the position: the market sustains internal changes which were not taken into account.</p>

Saudi Arabia has since confirmed that it is back up to full production levels as of yesterday.Meanwhile, a recent Reuters survey suggests that OPEC output hit an eight-year low in September. Speculative investors were net buyers of the commodity in the week to September 24, the latest data snapshot from CFTC shows. <strong>NATURAL GAS</strong> prices have been sliding for the past four sessions, with the commodity reaching the lowest level since August 30 yesterday. The commodity closed below the 55-day moving average at 2.319 on Monday, the first time since August 28. Surging US production and a slackening in demand triggered by expectations for milder weather in the US Mid-west and East in the near future are keeping a lid on prices.The supply/demand mismatch is seeing gas stockpiles increasing, with the latest data from EIA as at September 20 showing an increase of 102 billion cubic feet (bcf). Thats the biggest weekly addition to inventories in 14 weeks. Forecasts for this weeks release due tomorrow show expectations of another 86bcf addition.Speculative accounts turned net sellers of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/natural-gas"" id=""5fc34888223fe"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8862"">natural gas</a></span> for the first time in six weeks, according to the latest data as at September 24 from CFTC.</p>

<h3><strong>Precious metals</strong></h3><p></p>
<p><strong>GOLD</strong> was given a bit of a reprieve yesterday as the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/us-dollar-index"" id=""5fc34888224b2"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8827"">US dollar</a></span> retreated and investors searched for safe haven assets after a disappointing US <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/ism-manufacturing-pmi-173"" id=""5fc3488822c48"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""173"">ISM manufacturing PMI</a></span> print for September. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc3488822564"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">Gold</a></span> had touched the weakest in almost two months before rebounding, but still looks to be capped by the 55-day moving average at 1,490. That moving average had acted as a support for prices from end-May until last Monday. September was a bad month for gold as it fell 3.1%, bringing a four month rally to a halt.</p>
<p>Speculative investors remain bullish on the yellow metal however, boosting net long positions to the most since July 2016, according to the latest data from CFTC. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) added to their gold holdings for an 11th consecutive day, Bloomberg reported yesterday. Russias finance ministry said yesterday that the countrys gold production rose 10.5% in the first six months of 2019 from a year earlier, hitting 135.33 tonnes.</p>

Speculative accounts reduced net long positions for a third straight week in the week to September 24, according to CFTC. Net longs are now at the lowest in three weeks. ETFs have been net buyers so far this year and, as of yesterday, year-to-date purchases have reached 103.3 million ounces.</p>

It hit the lowest level since August 28 this morning and is facing the biggest weekly loss since October 2016. The 100-week moving average at 871.99 is being tested for the first time since end-August. Speculative investors have been caught unawares by the latest drop as net long positioning is at its most bullish since March 2018.</p>

Palladium has fallen for the past three days and the nearest possible support point could be the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the August-September rally at 1,626.70.</p>
<p>Speculative investors were well positioned for the move to record highs, having boosted net long positions for a fourth week to September 24, taking them to the highest in eight weeks.</p>
<p></p><h3><strong>Base metals</strong></h3>
<p>The weak US manufacturing PMI data pressured<strong> COPPER</strong> prices to the lowest in almost a month yesterday. The industrial metal is slightly higher today, hoping to snap the two-day losing streak. Speculative investors turned net sellers of the metal for the first time in three weeks, according to data to September 24 from CFTC.Chile announced that its <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/copper"" id=""5fc348882280f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8831"">copper</a></span> production was up 11.1% y/y in August, the biggest jump since 2018, but it can partially be explained by maintenance work that was carried out in August last year.</p>
<h3><strong>Agriculturals</strong></h3><p></p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc34888228bf"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">SOYBEANS</a></span></strong> are on track for the biggest weekly gain in three weeks after posting a 4.1% rally in the past two days. News that China is offering tariff waivers on some US imports together with lower US stockpiles and the prospect of tighter supply going forward are giving prices a lift. Wet weather in the US Mid-west is threatening to delay the US harvest.</p>
<p>Soybeans hit the highest level since July 15 yesterday, though the 55-day moving average at 8.671 looks poised to cross below the 100-day moving average at 8.666, which is often interpreted as a medium-term bearish signal.</p>
<p>Speculative accounts turned net bullish on the commodity for the first time since the week of July 23 after being net buyers for a second consecutive week, latest data from CFTC suggest.</p>

Estimates for the 2020/21 season suggest a shortfall of seven million tons. The commodity looks set to advance for a third consecutive week, the longest rising streak since June, and closed yesterday at 0.1205. There are a number of technical resistance points to the upside however. The 55-week moving average is at 0.1206, the 200-day moving average is at 0.1208 and the 100-week moving average is at 0.1224.</p>

<h2><strong>Precious metals</strong></h2>
<p>Gold extended recent gains this morning to reach the highest since August 2013 as U.S data released last night implied a potential <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/dallas-fed-mfg-business-index-658"" id=""5fc3485890307"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""658"">economic slowdown</a></span>. The yellow metal looks set to advance for a sixth consecutive week, which would equal the longest stretch since 2016. Bullish bets by speculative investors are now at their highest since January 2018 after seeing an increase for the third consecutive week in the week to June 18, the latest data snapshot from CFTC shows.</p>
<p>Data out of China showed the nation had increased its gold holdings for a sixth straight month in May, with purchases of 14.9 million tons. Exchange-traded funds have also been adding to holdings, adding 1.03 million ounces last Friday, the most in one day since June 2018, which brought total net purchases this year to 2.63 million ounces.</p>

<p>Whereas gold has the benefit of its safe haven status, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/silver"" id=""5fc348588f884"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8836"">silver</a></span> is more used for industrial purposes and the clouded outlook for the global economy is weighing on the precious metal. The gold/silver (Mint) ratio was boosted to a record high this morning, according to data compiled by OANDA going back to 2006, as silver lagged behind its safe haven big brother.</p>
<p>The Semiconductor Industry Association reported that the industrys demand for silver in the first quarter was 13% lower than a year earlier, and slackening demand didnt let up in April, with a 14.6% y/y decline.</p>
<p>Speculative investors still remain bullish on the commodity despite its relatively lackluster performance, adding to net long positions for a third straight week and boosting them to the highest in 10 weeks.</p>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/platinum"" id=""5fc348588f932"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8910"">Platinum</a></span> remains in consolidation above four-month lows and looks set to advance for a second consecutive week this week. However, from a technical perspective the 55-day moving average is about to cross below the 100-day moving average for the first time since March, which is often interpreted as a longer-term bearish signal. The 200-day moving average at 830.12 acts as the first resistance point. Platinum is now at 815.62</p>
<p>Speculative accounts have been trimming net long positions for the past seven weeks and as at June 18 they are at the lowest since the week of February 19, according to CFTC data.</p>
<p>In contrast, speculative investors seem to favor<strong> </strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/palladium"" id=""5fc348588f9e8"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8883"">palladium</a></span> as they increased net bullish bets for a fifth straight week, boosting them to the highest since the week of March 26, latest CFTC data show. Palladium rose to the highest level since March 27 this morning, and looks poised to post the fourth weekly gain in a row. The metal is testing resistance at the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement of the March-May decline at 1,541 and has so far reached 1,548.</p>
<h2><strong>Base metals</strong></h2>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/copper"" id=""5fc348588fa9a"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8831"">Copper</a></span> posted the biggest weekly gain since March last week and this week could mark the third weekly advance in a row. The rebound from support at the 200-week moving average at 2.6211 has turned speculative investors more bullish on the commodity as they turned net buyers for the first time in nine weeks in the week to June 18, the latest data from CFTC show. The buying pulled net short positioning away from a three-year peak.</p>
<p>On the supply front, Chiles third-largest mine is facing extended strike action after workers rejected the owners wage offer on Saturday. The miner now has another five days to present a new offer with the strike now in its eleventh day. The mine previously endured a 17-day strike in 2013, according to Bloomberg reports. Stockpiles of copper held in warehouses tracked by the London Metal Exchange fell on Friday, pulling back from 10 month highs.</p>
<h2><strong>Energy</strong></h2>
<p>Crude oil prices surged the most in a year last week as an escalation in Gulf tensions and proposed additional U.S sanctions against Iran prompted buying. The surge in prices prompted speculative buying, with investors turning net buyers for the first time in eight weeks to June 18.</p>
<p>According to a recent report from BP, OPECs share of the global oil market is shrinking as it cuts production by its members in an attempt to boost prices. OPECs share of global production fell to 41.5% last year, the report says, and it is expected to shrink further this year given the organizations planned cuts and U.S sanctions against Venezuela and Iran.</p>
<p>Chinas May crude oil imports rose 3.0% from a year earlier, a slowdown from Aprils 10.8% gain, latest data from the Customs Bureau show.</p>

Prices saw the biggest weekly drop since January last week but are attempting a rebound this week, climbing the most since January 14 yesterday. Forecasts of warmer weather across the central U.S. could have helped the rebound.</p>
<p>However, stockpiles continue to grow, with data to June 21 showing an increase of 115 billion cubic feet (bcf), thats higher than the five-year average of +84bcf and the 12th consecutive weekly increase in stockpiles. Speculative investors are still bearish on Gas, increasing net short positions to the highest since January 2018 in the week to June 18.</p>
<h2><strong>Agriculturals</strong></h2>
<p>Commodity markets are waiting for the next U.S Department of Agriculture report on grain stocks, which is due to be published on June 28. Forecasts suggest that <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc348588fc00"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">wheat</a></span> plantings could be reduced, while <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc348588fca5"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybean</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc348588fd49"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">corn</a></span> stocks are expected to increase.</p>
<p>Wheat prices have risen every day so far this week but have failed to reach the 10-month highs of last week. Speculative accounts remained net buyers of wheat for the seventh consecutive week to June 18, and net long positions are now at the highest since October 2018.</p>
<p>Chinas <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-sugar-no11"" id=""5fc348588fdec"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8869"">sugar</a></span> imports rose to 380,000 tons in May, the highest in more than a year, after China issued additional import permits for 1.35 million tons towards the end of May. The news helped stem a five-day decline in prices yesterday as the commodity tested the 55-day moving average support at 0.1214.</p>
<p>Speculative investors trimmed their net short positions to the least in seven weeks, according to data from CFTC to June 18.</p>

<p>Argentinas corn production is expected to increase 1.8% in June, according to an update by the Agriculture Secretariat on its website reported by Bloomberg. Prices are consolidating near five-year highs and holding below the 100-month moving average at 4.6616.</p>
<p>Soybeans are hovering near four-month highs as wet weather in the U.S is dragging on and preventing crops seeding, hence raising supply concerns and boosting prices. Net short positions held by speculative investors are at the lowest since the week of February 5, when they were marginally positive. Investors flipped to being net short the following week.</p>

This was the markets 1st up week in 3 weeks, no doubt aided by the fact that forecasters are now placing more chance of a Fed rate cut, than any rate hikes in 2016.</p>
<p>Financials remain the weakest sector year-to-date, with no rate hike in sight. The Financial sector will also lose some important window dressing in September, when Standard &amp; Poors breaks out Real Estate REITs into a new sector C REITs had been propping up the Financial sectors dividend yield, in addition to adding to earnings.</p>

Also relating to supply, Saudi Arabias Energy Minister commented yesterday that markets were moving in the right direction and it may not be necessary for Saudi Arabia to make deeper cuts to its production output. That said, OPEC+ still sees oil inventories as too high, with an overhang of between 70 and 80 million barrels. The next key OPEC meeting will be held in May.</p>
<p>Oil prices touched $64.63 this morning after posting a 1.9% gain yesterday, the most in a week.

The 200-day moving average at $61.377 would be the first technical support point.</p>

In addition, gas inventories are 30% below normal levels, increasing the risk of a spike higher should any supply issues arise. An increase in gas exports from Norway recently has pushed the UK market into surplus.</p>
<p>The lack of momentum in either direction has seen speculative investors trim their net short positions to the lowest since the week of February 12, according to the latest data snapshot as of April 2 from <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-natural-gas-speculative-net-positions-1820"" id=""5fc347ec92203"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1820"">CFTC</a></span>.

The inability to maintain the foothold above 1,300 consistently has seen speculative accounts turn net sellers for the first time in three weeks in the week to April 2, the latest <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-gold-speculative-net-positions-1618"" id=""5fc347ec922a2"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1618"">CFTC</a></span> data shows.</p>
<p>Data out of China has shown that the nation extended its recent gold buying spree, buying 360,000 ounces of the precious metal in March as prices rose as much as 0.9% on the month before closing 1.6% lower. Meanwhile, data released by the Russian central bank shows it added one million ounces of gold to its reserves in February, the most since November 2018.</p>

The metal is attempting a rebound from the 15-week lows this week amid signs of broader weakness in the U.S. dollar. The decline stalled just ahead of the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the November to February rally at 14.850. The decline forced many speculative longs positions to be scaled back, with investors reducing net longs to the lowest since the week of December 11, according to <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/cftc-silver-speculative-net-positions-1621"" id=""5fc347ec9234b"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""1621"">CFTC</a></span> data.

Prices are still attempting to recover some of the steep losses suffered on March 29 after the US Department of Agricultures (USDA) report suggested that US acreage and stockpiles were set to increase.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another USDA report saw corn imports by Bangladesh picking up in the next season starting July, amid a rising population and an expanding poultry industry. Corn is now at 3.544 with the 200-day moving average sitting above at 3.588.</p>

The commodity has been trading in an 8.73 C 9.00 range since early March and a sustained break above 9.00 would be needed to confirm a double-bottom chart pattern is in place from the lows on March 12 and 29. Speculative investors turned net sellers for the first time in three weeks up to April 2, according to CFTC data.</p>

Grain prices on the Euronext European Exchange reached a 6-week maximum level due to the active purchases by countries such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia amid a weak euro. Australia previously cut its wheat crop forecast by 10% due to drought.</p>
<p>On the daily timeframe <strong>Wheat: D1</strong> is in uptrend. Various technical analysis indicators have generated signals to increase. Further growth of quotations is possible in case of an increase in global demand amid a decline in inventories of producing countries.</p>

<p></p><li>The<strong> MACD indicator</strong> gives a bullish signal.</li></ul><p></p>
<p>The bullish momentum may develop if <strong>Wheat</strong> exceeds its last upper fractal and 200-day moving average line: 493. This level can be used as an entry point. The initial stop lose may be placed below the last 3 lower fractals, the Parabolic signal and the lower Bollinger line: 450. After opening the pending order, the stop shall be moved following the Bollinger and Parabolic signals to the next fractal minimum. Thus, we are changing the potential profit/loss to the breakeven point. More risk-averse traders may switch to the 4-hour chart after the trade and place a stop loss moving it in the direction of the trade. If the price meets the stop level (450) without reaching the order (493), we recommend to cancel the order: the market sustains internal changes that were not taken into account.</p>

<p>Here we'll take a closer look at key principals of investing in commodities futures through ETFs as well as a commodities ETF to consider:</p><h2><strong>'Rolling-Over': What It Means, Why It Matters</strong><strong><br></strong></h2><p>Most commodity exchange-traded funds own futures contractscontracts for future delivery, but not the physical commodity itself.</p>
<p>However, investors should note that future contracts expire every month, so stocks trade in perpetuity. Yet, futures contracts have expiration dates. So to avoid physical delivery at contract expiry, these funds replace expiring contracts with new contracts that end later, a process known as rolling-over.""</p>
<p>Two other key terms to note are ""contango and backwardation.</p>
<p>When a market is in contango, the forward price of a futures contract is higher than the current spot price.&nbsp;Contango causes commodity ETFs based on a futures contract to incur a roll-over loss.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when a market is in backwardation, the forward price of the futures contract is lower than the spot price. In that case, there would not be a roll-over loss, but rather a roll-over gain.</p>
<p>Rolling-over into new contracts can be done in a range of ways involving different combinations of futures contracts that a fund can choose from. Rolling-over costs change daily.</p>
<p>Due to this cost structure, returns of such commodity funds can differ from physical commodity prices. Negative roll yields typically decrease returns over time.</p><h2><strong>1. Invesco Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Strategy No K-1 ETF </strong></h2><ul>

Other holdings include<strong> NY Harbor ULSD, Natural Gas </strong>and <strong>Silver.</strong></p>
<p>Year-to-date, the fund is down over 16%.</p>
<p>Commodity price changes mostly depend on supply and demand dynamics. For example, during a cold winter, as the demand for<strong> <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/natural-gas"" id=""5fc348f3a5c51"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8862"">natural gas</a></span></strong> increases, so do prices. Commodity prices also usually move higher during inflationary periods, as they are widely considered a hedge against inflation.</p>
<p>Historically, there has been a negative correlation between commodities and stocks. Academic research shows that by investing in commodity futures or ETFs based on these contracts, market participants may be able to decrease the volatility of an all-stock portfolio without reducing their expected return. Thus, investors who are interested in diversifying into commodities may consider researching the fund further.</p><h3><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h3><p>Diversification is a fundamental principle of long-term portfolio construction. Therefore, holding commodities as part of an asset-allocation strategy may be appropriate.</p>
<p>However, most commodity ETFs differ from traditional ETFs in a significant way: they typically use futures contracts. As a result, over time, these funds' returns may deviate substantially from the change of the spot price of the underlying commodity. Therefore, it is important to fully understand the potential risk/return profiles before investing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, in the U.S., there is a range of commodity ETF structures. So investors may want to ask their accountants about various tax implications of investing in these ETFs.</p>

Upside, a weekly settlement above 595.75 maintains a bullish dynamic into later contract life, 704.75 ultra-long-term resistance then expected over the next 3-5 months (weeks?), where the broader Wheat market can top out through next year.</p>
<p><strong>Hedger's Highlights</strong></p>
<p>Remain hedged below 595.75 as 505.50 remains a 3-5 week target where hedges can be lifted through October trade. Reset hedges following daily settlement below 505.50, as 421.25 becomes a 5-8 week target where long-term hedges can be lifted into next summer. Upside, lift hedges following weekly settlement above 595.75, as 704.75 becomes a 2-3 month (possibly 3-5 week) target where hedges can be set into next summer.</p>

<p></p><p>Since then, each component of the grains sector has had its own wild ride, apparently driven by fundamentals. Yet, oddly, the same character has been behind the volatility in all three in recent years: U.S. President Donald Trump.</p><p></p>
<p>Back in 2012, more than 70 percent of the U.S. Midwest was in some stage of drought in July that year, the worst dry planting conditions in the United States since at least 1956.</p>
<p></p><p>While the drought sent grain prices soaring, the squeeze on yields and harvests were bad for farmers and consumers, as corn, soybean and wheat crops in the United States  the largest world exporter of those key crops  lay baking in fields, losing yield potential daily or being plowed under for insurance claims.</p><p></p>
<p></p><h2 dir=""ltr"">Grains Traded At Their Highest This Decade During The 2012 Drought </h2>
<p>At the height of the 2012 drought, soybeans traded near $17.89 a bushel, wheat at almost $9.44 and corn near $8.44.<br><br>Ever the catalyst of market unpredictability, Trump sent soybeans to 10-year lows of around $7.91 per bushel in May this year as the U.S. trade war with China peaked. Until the trade spat really took hold in the summer of 2018, China had been purchasing more than half of all of its soybeans from the United States.<br><br></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img title=""U.S. Soybeans Futures Monthly Chart"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic5e4935779e9ee0a5e72bb1cc1ed5df50.png"" alt=""U.S. Soybeans Futures Monthly Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">U.S. Soybeans Futures Monthly Chart</span></div></div></div><br><br>As China put up retaliatory tariffs of its own against the U.S. last year, Chinese imports of U.S. soy reached zero in August, September and October 2018.<br><br>A year down the road, things have gotten better for U.S. soy, with the Chinese rolling back their tariffs in a gesture that seems to indicate that a trade deal might be happening. Soybean futures traded in Chicago have recovered lately to around $9.41 per bushel.<p></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr"">No Certainty Over Soybeans Till China Trade Deal Is Signed</h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>Yet, until the trade deal is signed, demand for U.S. soy isnt exactly out of the woods yet. <br><br>With persistent reports about the Chinese being unhappy with Trumps condition that Beijing commit in advance to buying $50 billion of U.S. farm products a year, there is no knowing what the compromise will be. <br><br>And the longer it takes for the deal to be signed, the more uncertainty for the soy trade, particularly with how Trump, whos seeking reelection in November, will react.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>Since talk began ramping up at end-October of a potential U.S.-China deal, China's monthly purchase of U.S. soybeans has more than doubled to 2.6 million tons in November. Still, Brazil remains China's biggest soy supplier, with 3.9 million tons imported last month. </p><p></p>
<p>China has also been ramping up soy imports from Russia. Last week, Russian media reported that the country is delivering soybeans to China by train for the first time, according to Chinese agriculture database CoFeed. State-owned enterprise China Oil and Food Corporation (COFCO) will receive 250 tons of Russian soybeans this month.</p>
<p>U.S. and Chinese officials have said they will begin negotiations on the second phase of their trade deal immediately after the first is concluded. Even so, Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson Gao Feng said last week that Beijing ""firmly opposed"" the U.S. National Defense Authorization Act, which Trump signed into law this month.</p>
<p>China was mentioned 202 times in that legislation and U.S. lawmakers plan to confront China on a variety of threats and concerns, including sanctions on Chinese companies, Chinese efforts to infiltrate U.S. universities and research institutions and China's Belt and Road Initiative. The act also makes it tougher to lift sanctions on telecom giant Huawei.</p>
<p></p><h2 dir=""ltr"">China Continues To Bristle At U.S. Intervention In Normal Company Operations</h2>
<p>The defense act's ""restrictions on purchasing Chinese products and Chinese companies' exports are bad examples of government intervention into companies' normal operation and activities, which is the opposite of the U.S.'s values of free and fair trade. It harms international trade and global industry chain,"" Gao said. ""China will closely monitor NDAA's impacts on Chinese companies and take necessary measures to protect Chinese companies' rights.""<br><br>Aside from the disruption to the soybeans trade, Trump also upset the corn lobby a week ago by giving the upper hand to oil refiners in their bid to reduce the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/ethanol-futures"" id=""5fc348b6e0128"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""961732"">ethanol</a></span> content in gasoline. </p>
<h2 dir=""ltr"">Corn Hovering Near 3-Month Lows As Trump Upsets Ethanol Lobby</h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>Corn is hovering near 3-month lows of around $3.89 per bushel, though that is still markedly higher than the six-year low of $3.01 hit in August 2016 from a global glut in corn supplies that year.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>The Trump administration finalized U.S. biofuel blending requirements for 2020 last week, leaving a key part of the rule unchanged from an earlier proposal that the corn lobby had criticized as inadequate to help struggling farmers.<br><br></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img title=""U.S. Corn Futures Monthly Chart"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic239ca3334dc874f666b38298f271f751.png"" alt=""U.S. Corn Futures Monthly Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">U.S. Corn Futures Monthly Chart</span></div></div></div><p></p><p></p>
<p>The move is destined to anger biofuel industry officials and corn-state senators who had pushed hard for changes until the 11th hour, potentially threatening President Donald Trumps support among farmers ahead of next years election.</p>
<p>Under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), the Environmental Protection Agency is charged with setting biofuel blending requirements for the refining industry to help farmers by boosting demand for corn- and soybean-based fuels, while reducing U.S. dependence on <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc348b6e01dc"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">oil</a></span>.</p>
<p>The finalized rule increases the volume for blending requirements to 20.09 billion gallons in 2020, up from 19.92 billion gallons in 2019. The mandate included 15 billion gallons of conventional biofuels like ethanol, unchanged from 2019.</p>
<p>Trump and top White House officials directly intervened in discussions about the biofuel requirements this fall in an attempt to appease farmers, whose support Trump is counting on in Novembers presidential election.</p>
<p>Apparently President Trump doesnt care about his promise to Iowas farmers, said Iowa Corn Growers Association President Jim Greif, adding that the lobby will not stop fighting for market access for corn in all forms.</p>
<p></p><h2 dir=""ltr"">President Denigrates Wheat, Hurting Farmers </h2><p></p>
<p>As for wheat, during the summer, Trump made derisive remarks about U.S.  sales of the grain to Japan, describing wheat as a poor trade exchange for the cars the Japanese sold to the United States.</p>
<p></p><p>The Trump administration did get a trade agreement with Tokyo earlier this month that paves the way for cheaper American beef and other agricultural products to Japan. Tokyo, in return, won cuts in U.S. tariffs for certain manufactured goods, such as machine tools and musical instruments.</p>
<p>And wheat prices are at near 2-?-year highs of $5.58 per bushel now because of drought again  this time in Australia and Russia.  </p>
<p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img title=""U.S. Wheat Futures Monthly Chart"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picf6bd9bfd0e31c570d650da1aee18a53e.png"" alt=""U.S. Wheat Futures Monthly Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">U.S. Wheat Futures Monthly Chart</span></div></div></div><p></p><p></p>
<p></p><p>Yet, when Trump made his remarks about wheat in August, the market was at around three-month lows of around $4.56 per bushel, prompting The Oregon Wheat Growers League to say it was profoundly disappointed with the president.</p><p></p>
<p>We appreciate many of the things that the Trump administration has done for agriculture, but we sincerely hope that the President will take the time to learn about and appreciate the great success story and heritage that has been built between wheat growers in the U.S. and our customers in Japan, the League said in a statement.</p>
<p>It suggested total ignorance on Trumps part of the relationships between Japanese millers and U.S. farmers that began in 1949, when a trade delegation was set up to investigate the expansion of wheat sales.</p>
<p></p><p>Since then, Japan has become the No. 1 market for U.S. wheat and the No. 2 market for soft white wheat grown in the Pacific Northwest, the League said. U.S. wheat has a 50% market share in Japan.</p><p></p>
<p>Our customers in Japan dont buy our wheat because they are doing us a favor or to make us feel good, they buy our wheat because we have built a relationship with them, earned their trust, listened to their needs, and provided great customer service, the organization stated.</p>
<p>This is not a situation in which theyre simply buying what can be close to $1 billion worth of wheat a year for political reasons, added Steve Mercer, vice president of communications for U.S. Wheat Associates, the overseas marketing arm for the industry. This is a need and a desire on the part of their industry to purchase U.S. wheat.</p>
<p>Japan has purchased an average of 2.91 million metric tons in each of the last five years, Mercer said.</p>
<p>Chandler Goule, CEO of the National Association of Wheat Growers, also described Trumps comments as very frustrating. </p>
<p>Goule added:</p>
<p></p><blockquote>The President claims to be continually supporting farmers, but started a trade war, and then directly attacks the bread basket commodity of the United States.</blockquote><p></p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

1606633198-3367,https://www.investing.com/commodities/oats-opinion/1,U.S. Natural Gas Leads Global Commodities With 60% Rally On The Year,https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-natural-gas-leads-global-commodities-charge-with-60-rally-on-year-200359411,"By Investing.com (Barani Krishnan/Investing.com)CommoditiesNov 15, 2018 03:14AM ET","<p>Not many can recall the last time the US <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/natural-gas"" id=""5fc346eaa2fb2"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8862"">natural gas</a></span> market, known as the Wild West of commodities for its legacy of bucking-bronco-like price swings, jumped 18 percent in a day.</p>
<p>That happened on October 28 2010, when a serial <em>derecho</em>, or windstorm with severe thunderstorms, generated a pre-winter blizzard across most of the US, causing heating demand to spike.</p>
<h3><strong>Explosive Price Surge</strong></h3>
<p>That day, eight years ago, the front-month gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange gained almost 60 cents per million British thermal units to settle at $3.89 per mmBtu.</p>
<p>So, this Wednesday, when NYMEXs front-month gas settled up 74 cents, or 18 percent, at a near 5-year high of 4.84 per mmBtu on fears of a pre-winter storm market, participants ran out of superlatives trying to characterize the explosive surge in a commodity that had seldom moved more than a couple percent in a day during the past four years.</p>
<p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picd2dfead585134bbe31c72e4b0c91ed78.jpeg"" alt=""Natural Gas Weekly Chart"" title=""Natural Gas Weekly Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Natural Gas Weekly Chart</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p>The year-to-date gain in natural gas is now just shy of 60 percent, the highest for any commodity. The nearest competitor, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/oats"" id=""5fc346eaa3245"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""959199"">oats</a></span>, is up by just 20 percent.</p>
<p>This is in stark comparison to <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc346eaa3302"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">oil</a></span>, an energy peer as it were, which has given up as much as 25 percent in the past six weeks alone.</p>
<h3><strong>'Fear Of God' Grips Gas Traders</strong></h3>
<p>Tight storage and cold weather has finally put the fear of God in traders, Dan Flynn at Chicagos Price Futures Group wrote after Wednesdays rally in gas, citing <a href=""https://weather.com/storms/winter/news/2018-11-14-winter-storm-avery-snow-ice-east-midwest-south"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Winter Storm Avery</a>, which weather models showed was headed for the Northeast after spreading a mix of rain, snow and ice in parts of the mid-Mississippi Valley and Ohio Valley.</p>
<p>Some analysts were remorseful for having misled others with their forecasts. A lot of things I predicted have been wrong, as I was bearish, confessed Scott Shelton, energy broker at ICAP in Durham, North Carolina, who writes daily notes on both oil and gas.</p>
<p>Shelton said while his initial calls looked great when the market was moving in his favor, it now has gone horribly wrong as he had underestimated the colder-than-usual weather for November. Sheltons words underscore the caution expressed by some market participants who remember the 2010 spike: natural gas should forever be remembered as a sleeper market that can suddenly turn into a killer, capable of felling even the best of traders with sudden, double-digit swings.</p>
<p>While its too early to know who the winners and losers were of Wednesdays epic move, theres a long list of traders in the past who became casualties by incorrectly betting on demand for gas during peak summer cooling and winter heating periods.</p>
<p>Among the vanquished, the most memorable has to be Brian Hunter, a Canadian-born gas trader, who after a few high profile wins in the early 2000s, lost nearly $7 billion in 2006, blowing up his hedge fund employer Aramanth Advisors. Interestingly, Hunter fell to a peculiar trade in natural gas called the widowmaker, which involves a play between the March and April months, when switches between cold and warm weather become particularly dicey calls for gas traders.</p>
<p>Among the victors, the biggest would arguably be John Arnold, a former Enron trader who used his proprietary hedge fund Centaurus Advisors to take bets on the opposite side of Hunter's play in 2006, instantly making him one of Americas youngest billionaires by the age of 33.</p>
<h3><strong>Difficult Market To Read</strong></h3>
<p>Notwithstanding such anecdotes, natural gas is a market of many contrasts. Despite being the fuel of choice for US power generators and <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/ng_move_expc_s1_m.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">exported</a> in liquefied form to about three dozen countries, open interest in natural gas futures itself is under $76 billion versus the more than $116 billion for US <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc346eaa33b7"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">crude oil</a></span>.</p>
<p>This year, the gas market has been particularly hard to read for most traders. Abundant volumes of gas, sourced from primary drilling and also obtained in secondary form during drilling for shale crude, has led to record production of the fuelnot unlike the situation in crude oil.</p>
<p>Despite that overwhelming output, storage levels of gas were never in danger of tipping, thanks first to strong summer heat, then to early cold that kept air conditioners and heaters running on overdrive. While prices north of $3 per mmBtu had been the norm in recent months, the shock to the upside of $4 arrived this week when market bulls sensed a colder-than-usual November.</p>
<p>And before the bears knew what hit them, the market was at the cusp of $5 pricing. With at least 3-1/2 months of potential cold weather left, the path of least resistance certainly seems lower for now.</p>
<p>Dan Myers, analyst at Houston-based Gelber &amp; Associates said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The addition of a trend to colder forecasts in late November is further reinforcing the markets sense that we are heading straight into a major winter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dominick Chirichella of the Energy Management Institute in New York added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Low inventories and cold temperatures are keeping the bears out of the market, with the bulls solidly in control.</p>

The darling of the markets last year saw bullish bets increase steadily from August through to December while the price rally lasted all the way through until March. Net long positions held by speculative accounts are now at their lowest since the week of September 18 with palladium trading at 1,322.</p>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/gold"" id=""5fc34823e0ac4"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8830"">Gold </a></span> has succumbed to the U.S. dollars strength since last week and slid the most in four weeks last week. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, gold has been unable to secure a safe haven foothold and has failed to register a close above the key 1,300 level so far this month. It is even facing the fourth monthly decline in a row after peaking at 1,347 in February.</p>
<p>That said, speculative investors still remain bullish on the yellow metal, adding to net long positions for a third straight week to May 14, while boosting net longs to the highest since February 26.</p>
<p>In contrast, speculative investors increased their bearish bets against <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/silver"" id=""5fc34823e0b73"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8836"">silver</a></span> for a second straight week, the latest data from CFTC to May 14 shows, with net short positioning is at its highest since November. Exchange-traded funds sold 3.3 million ounces of silver from their holdings in the latest trading session, according to a Bloomberg report yesterday. That was the biggest one-day cut since January 18.</p>

The rebound proved to be short-lived however, with those gains having been wiped out already this week.</p>
<p>The ongoing U.S.-China trade war continues to be a burden for <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/copper"" id=""5fc34823e0cc5"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8831"">copper</a></span> as stocks at warehouses monitored by the London Metal Exchange have remained steady since May 8.</p>

The cartel and its allies agreed to keep the current production cuts in place past the June deadline, though there was an element of dissent from Russia. The continuing spat between the U.S. and China is causing a rethink of future oil demand, and the weekly oil stockpile data from both the EIA and API have both showing increases in inventories recently.</p>
<p>Tonights data release from the American Petroleum Institute is expected to show a further increase of 2.4 million barrels in the week to May 17, after an addition of 8.6 million barrels the previous week.</p>

Forecasts of cooler weather across Scandinavia next week may help to support prices with an increase in demand seen for heating purposes, but this is countered somewhat by forecasts of normal temperatures across the rest of Europe for the same period.</p>
<p><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/natural-gas"" id=""5fc34823e0ec4"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8862"">Natural gas</a></span> needs to break above the 55-day moving average at 2.6509 to stand a chance of a more constructive rebound. This moving average has capped prices on a closing basis since December 18 last year. Gas is currently trading at 2.611.</p>

This could form a potential outside-range day for the commodity, a bullish technical signal which would be confirmed with another higher close today.</p>
<p>The rebound could have been caused by supply concerns coupled with an uptick in demand for ethanol production. Heavy rains are reportedly slowing the harvest in Brazil, while higher oil prices are expected to trigger a spike in ethanol demand, particularly in Brazil.</p>
<p>The latest data shows that speculative investors are not so enthusiastic about a prolonged rally. They increased their net short positions for a second week, bringing net short positions to the highest since the week of October 2.</p>

The rally comes amid a perceived shortage of supply, with reports suggesting that <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc34823e10dc"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">US corn</a></span> planting for this time of year has been reduced to the slowest pace on record amid storms, flooding and tornadoes.</p>
<p>Couple that with a market that was perhaps overly short of the commodity and the rebound took flight. Latest data from CFTC showed that net short positions were already being scaled back for a second straight week as at May 14, but were still aggressively net short.</p>

Speculative accounts reduced their net short positions for a second straight week in the week to May 14, according to CFTC data, and they are now at the lowest in four weeks. Reports are also suggesting the EU exports are down 1% in the 2019 season which started last July.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Gold On Track For Fifth Straight Month In The Red</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Gold, trailing the dollar as safe haven since March, has spent the past six weeks in the red. It will finish a fifth month in negative territory unless it makes a turnaround in August.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">At Fridays settlement, US gold futures most actively-traded December futures settled at $1,211.10 a troy ounce, with Investing.coms daily <a href=""/commodities/gold-technical"">technicals</a> maintaining a Sell call. While Fibonacci patterns indicate Level 3 support at $1217.17 today, many whove witnessed bullions decline from January highs of $1,357.20 believe gold bears will attempt new lows in the risk-averse environment created by the lira.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Some think bullion would go higher if it had been oversold. But data on Friday from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed hedge funds and other big speculators were still shedding their bullish bets on US gold for a fourth straight week, reaching a 2015 low in net holdings.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Traders are opting for cash-is-king trades , abandoning bullion, said George Gero, precious metals analyst at RBC Capital in New York. All this means is a dollar surge to highs not seen since 2017 that caps golds rally.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Oil Market Split Over Consequences Of Iran Sanctions</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">US sanctions against Iran and the resultant hit on Tehrans oil exports are likely to help crude prices come out of their biggest losing streak since 2015, some analysts said.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">At last weeks settlement of $67.63 a barrel, WTI is still a Strong Sell on Investing.coms daily <a href=""/commodities/crude-oil-technical"">technicals</a>, with Fibonacci readings placing first support at $67.65, second at $67.57 and third at $67.44.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Brent, which settled at $72.81, is also a Strong Sell by daily <a href=""/commodities/brent-oil-technical"">technicals</a>, with Fibonacci support seen at $71.79, $71.37 and $70.71</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The United States said last week it has started implementing new sanctions against Iran, which will also target the country's petroleum sector starting from November. One million barrels of Irans daily output, which stands at approximately 2.5 million barrels, could be at risk.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But with others in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) making up for the shortfall in Iranian oil exports, the sanctions on Tehran may not add up to much, Frankfurt-based Commerzbank said last week, adding that crude prices were probably justified at current or even lower levels.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Rising US oil output was also exacerbating worries about ample supplies.

Total American crude production is nearly 16 percent above year ago levels.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">A weaker dollar aside, oil bulls will be counting on another large drawdown in US <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/crude-oil-inventories-75"" id=""5fc34708ef85d"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""75"">storage numbers</a></span> on Wednesday. Last weeks 6.1 million-barrel decline was more than double the forecast, erasing the previous weeks buildup of 5.8 million.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">With only about six weeks of peak summer driving left in the US, crude consumption has turned volatile, leaving the proponents for higher oil prices to place their faith in domestic crude exports. With Washington and Beijing still struggling to find common ground in their trade war, the spotlight has fallen on the flow of about 400,000 barrels per day of US crude to China.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">US barrels may struggle to find alternative homes if Chinese appetite weans (particularly if sanctioned Iranian crudes muscle into China in larger size), RBC Capital Markets wrote in its weekly outlook.</p>
<p>The natural assumption would be that the US re-routes to Europe. Europe is a large consumer of US oil, but the competition among light, sweet barrels is fierce. This is highlighted by similar grades like North Sea and West African barrels that are currently struggling to find placement in a contango-ridden <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/brent-oil"" id=""5fc34708ef2b2"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8833"">Brent</a></span> market.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude settled at $68.69 a barrel in New York last week after reaching the $68.30 support that broke the bullish trendline. Investing.coms daily technicals have a <a href=""/commodities/crude-oil-technical"">Buy</a><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil-technical""></a> on WTI.

<p><strong>Gold Under Pressure; Escondida To Boost Copper</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Traders are still not seeking havens in gold, and the dollar is holding strength at over 94.50 on the index, George Gero, precious metals tracker at RBC, said in a pre-weekend note. All this keeps gold on the defensive for now, and the large continued open interest in options with large puts below key $1,200 (per ounce) may continue volatility all through this quarter. </p>

<h2><strong>Asia Pacific</strong>&nbsp;</h2>
<p><strong>Australia provided a pleasant surprise today in a day in which the surging virus has otherwise dealt a blow to sentiment. </strong>The lifting of the lockdown in Victoria saw a surge in <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/employment-change-94"" id=""5fc34923c6b10"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""94"">employment</a></span>. The nearly 179k increase blew away forecasts, where the median projection in the Bloomberg survey was for a loss of 27.5k jobs. The downward revision in September to show a&nbsp; loss of 42.5k positions (-29.5k initially) made the recovery all the more impressive. Full-time positions account for a little half (97k) of the employment gains. The fact that the participation rate jump to 65.8% from a revised 64.9% prevented the unemployment rate from improving (7.0% vs. 6.9%). The unexpected jump in employment was insufficient to prevent the Australian dollar from slipping lower in the risk-averse mood.</p>
<p><strong>A combination of strong demand from China and concerns that poor weather will make for a light crop has driven up soy prices to a six-year high. </strong>Prices are up 8% this month and almost 24% since the end of August. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc34923c6477"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">Wheat</a></span>&nbsp;prices are up 10% over the same period.&nbsp;US soy stocks are low, and China has promised to step up its purchases of US agriculture. Chinese demand is also thought to be driving the price of iron ore to new highs for the year. The front-month futures contract is up for the fourth consecutive session and nine of the past ten for around an 11% surge. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/copper"" id=""5fc34923c6524"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8831"">Copper</a></span> prices are consolidating since making a two-year high to start the week. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc34923c65cf"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">Oil</a></span> prices are at the upper end of where they traded over the past two months.</p>
<p><strong>The dollar is pushing back above JPY104 in the European morning after holding above yesterday's low (~JPY103.65) in local markets. </strong>There are options for around $950 mln struck between JPY104.25-JPY104.35 that expire today. This area may be sufficient to check stronger dollar gains today, but if not, another set of expiring options in the JPY104.50-JPY105.60 area for $1.6 bln should.</p>

Recall that it settled last week near $0.7270. <strong>The greenback is rising against the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-cny"" id=""5fc34923c672b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""2111"">Chinese yuan</a></span> for the second consecutive session,&nbsp; for the first time this month. </strong>Its nearly 0.5% gain is the most for nearly a month. Since dropping the ""counter-cyclical"" factor, the PBOC's reference rate for the dollar has become more transparent. Today's fix was at CNY6.5488, which was largely anticipated. The CNY6.60 and then CNY6.63 may cap corrective upticks in the US dollar.</p>
<h2><strong>Europe</strong></h2>
<p><strong>The EU is fighting a two-front battle. </strong>On one side are the trade talks with the UK. Several deadlines have already been missed, and sometime early next week is the next one. Even though the standstill agreement does not end until Dec.31, the agreement has to be ratified by all the members to take effect. Some UK reports played up the likelihood of a last-minute agreement, but EU officials still report little progress. That said, many in the market suspect that sterling could move around 5% in either direction, depending on the results. The EU is under pressure to publish its plans if there is not an agreement to help businesses prepare.</p>
<p><strong>On the other side is the EU's seven-year budget. </strong>It requires unanimity to be approved. Yet strings were attached to it regarding the rule of law that targets Poland and Hungary. They have rejected it. While many are sympathetic with the goal and the importance of the rule of law, the budget is arguably the wrong instrument to use precisely because of the consensus needed. There are other points of leverage, and the EU has both countries under formal investigation for not respecting the rule of law (independent judiciary and free press). A compromise has to be forged, and excluding Poland and Hungary is not really an option.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>As widely anticipated, Turkey's new central banker hiked the one-week repo rate to 15.00% from 10.25%. </strong>This is partly a catch-up move, given that effective funding costs were already above 14%. However, the move signals a return toward a more orthodox policy, and that means that the one-week repo rate has been reactivated rather than other secondary rates used over the last few months. The lira initially rallied but has seen the gains halved. The dollar fell from about TRY7.70 to TRY7.5150 before bouncing back above TRY7.62.</p>
<p><strong>Like the $0.7340 area in the Australian dollar, which proved a cap, the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/eur-usd"" id=""5fc34923c67d1"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""1"">euro</a></span> approached but was unable to move above $1.19 in the last couple of sessions. </strong>As the momentum stalled, the euro was vulnerable to the pullback. The week's low was set Monday near $1.1815. A break of $1.1800 could signal a deeper correction toward $1.1750. The $1.1840-$1.1850 area may cap the upside.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/gbp-usd"" id=""5fc34923c687c"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""2"">Sterling</a></span> was unable to push above last week's high (~$1.3315) yesterday and has been sold to $1.3200 today. </strong>Initial support is seen near $1.3185 and then around $1.3155. Resistance is now seen around $1.3240-$1.3250. The euro has edged higher against sterling. It had approached GBP0.8915 yesterday, and nearly 1.4 bln euros of options will expire today struck between GBP0.8900 and GBP0.8925. The euro is traded firmer in Asia but met new sellers in Europe near GBP0.8960. The cross settled last week near GBP0.8975 and has not traded above GBP0.9000 this week.</p>
<h2><strong>America</strong></h2>
<p><strong>The US reports <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/initial-jobless-claims-294"" id=""5fc34923c6bb9"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""294"">weekly jobless claims</a></span>, which are expected to have edged lower toward 700k. </strong>Many who have exhausted the benefits have qualified for the emergency federal extension, but these programs are set to expire at the end of the year. There is some hope that the appropriations bill, which must be passed by Dec. 11 to avoid a government shutdown, may include an extension, but it is far from certain.</p>
<p>The <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/philadelphia-fed-manufacturing-index-236"" id=""5fc34923c6c72"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""236"">Philadelphia</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/kc-fed-manufacturing-index-899"" id=""5fc34923c6cf7"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""899"">Kansas</a></span> Fed's November manufacturing surveys are also out today, and both are expected to have slowed. October <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/existing-home-sales-99"" id=""5fc34923c7130"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""99"">existing-home sales</a></span> may have pared some of the impressive 9.4% gains in September. The Leading Economic Indicator does not typically draw much attention, and this time it is doubly true as the surging virus and social restrictions make it seemingly less relevant.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Minority governments last about two years on average in Canada, and Prime Minister Trudeau's second year is off to a rocky start. </strong>The risk of an election early next year went up yesterday after the government lost a 176-146 vote that saw the opposition parties unite to call for a more direct confrontation with China. The non-binding called for the government to officially ban Huawei from its 5G build-out and offer a plan to counter efforts to intimidate Chinese nationals living in Canada. Trudeau says he is waiting for a report from Canada's intelligence services. However, given that the Five-Eyes intelligence alliance (Australia, New Zealand, the UK, the US, and Canada) have all moved to ban Huawei but Canada.</p>
<p><strong>The US dollar is at a three-day high against the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/currencies/usd-cad"" id=""5fc34923c690e"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""7"">Canadian dollar</a></span>, a little above CAD1.3100. </strong>It looks poised to test the week's high near CAD1.3140. That also corresponds to the 20-day moving average, which the greenback has not closed above since Nov. 2. Above there, the next target is CAD1.3170-CAD1.3200.

<li>August 10 derecho: a reminder of the fragile state of supplies</li>
<li>Food demand continues to grow</li>
<li>Three reasons why 2021 could be a bullish year for grain and oilseed prices</li>
</ul><p>The beginning of September means that the 2020 harvest season in the US and countries in the northern hemisphere is on the immediate horizon. Grains and oilseeds are the agricultural products that feed the world. All signs are that there will be ample supplies to meet all requirements over the coming months.</p>
<p>Each year is always a new adventure when it comes to agricultural commodity output. Mother Nature determines the weather, so she's responsible for the size of crops. The US is the worlds leading producer and exporter of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc3490150f4e"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">corn</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc349015118b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">soybeans</a></span>, and a leading producer of <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc3490151226"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">wheat</a></span>. Consumption is ubiquitous as all people worldwide require nutrition.</p>
<p>It has been eight years since a weather event caused corn, soybean, and wheat prices to soar. The 2012 drought sent corn and bean futures to all-time highs, and wheat rose to its highest price since the 2008 global drought. Since 2012, the world has added around 640 million more mouths to feed. The demand side of the fundamental equation for agricultural products is an ever-growing factor. Meanwhile, supply can be as fickle as the weather.</p><h2><strong>Late-season rally in soybeans, corn, and wheat</strong></h2><p>Grain and oilseed futures prices often experience rallies and increased price volatility during the spring planting and summer growing seasons because of the weathers uncertainty and its impact on annual supplies. In 2020, the futures markets experienced late-season rallies beginning in mid-August.</p>

It said supplies of the agricultural products will be ample in the 2020 crop year and sufficient to meet worldwide requirements.</p>
<p>However, two days before the USDA report, a derecho or violent winds and rainstorms swept across the fertile plains of the United States, causing some damage to crops. The weather event was a reminder that annual supplies of the products that feed the world are as fickle as the weather each year.</p>
<p>Mother Nature has cooperated with the agriculture markets in the US over the past eight years, but that is no guarantee for the future. The derecho was a wakeup call for consumers that abundant grain and oilseed supplies are a function of supportive weather conditions. The supply side of the fundamental equation in agricultural commodities is a year-to-year affair and can be highly variable.</p><h2><strong>Food demand continues to grow</strong></h2><p>Meanwhile, the demand side of the equation is an ever-growing factor for the products that feed the world. Each quarter, the worldwide population increases by about 20 million people. At the turn of this century, there were approximately six billion mouths to feed on our planet.</p>
<p></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock pointer"" onclick=""openAnalysisImgPopup(this)""><img title=""US and World Population Clock"" src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picf200def19244fe19e77be00c956f34ba.png"" alt=""US and World Population Clock""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><a href=""javascript:void(0);"" class=""zoomIcon""></a><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">US and World Population Clock</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p><em>Source: US Census Bureau</em></p>
<p>As the chart above shows, at the end of last week, that number stood at over 7.678 billion, almost 28% higher over the past two decades. The exponential population growth rate means that more people require more nutritional products each day.</p>
<p>The supply side of the equation for food needs to keep pace with the ever-rising demand. Therefore, the variability of supplies because of the weather could cause periods of extreme volatility in the grain and oilseed futures markets over the coming years if supplies become scarce.</p><h2><strong>Three reasons why 2021 could be a bullish year for grain and oilseed prices</strong></h2><p>The first reason for a bullish outlook in the agricultural markets in 2021 is demographics. The fundamental equation tells us that supply volatility and steadily increasing demand is a cocktail for significant price swings. Corn, soybean, and wheat prices are significantly lower than in 2012. A weather event could cause explosive rallies in the futures market. Since 2012, the global population and demand side of the equation has grown by 640 million people.</p>
<p>The second reason is the recent trend in the US dollar. The dollar is the pricing mechanism for most commodities, and the grain and oilseed markets are no exception. A falling dollar tends to push commodity prices higher.</p>

A falling dollar is bullish for corn, soybean, and wheat prices.</p>
<p>Finally, in late August, the US Federal Reserve told markets they are <span class=""aqPopupWrapper mediumTitle1 js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/analysis/fed-bids-goodbye-to-phillips-curve-and-preemptive-interest-rate-hikes-200535780"" id=""5fc3490151d76"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""pal"" data-articleid=""200535780"">willing to tolerate</a></span> higher inflation levels over the coming months and years. The 2% target became more of an average, with members of the Fed saying that since inflation has remained below the target for so long, they would be willing to see it above the target before raising short-term rates. Rising inflation, the unprecedented level of central bank liquidity, and government stimulus programs are all highly inflationary. Higher inflation is extremely supportive of rising commodity prices.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mother Nature holds the key to the agricultural markets. While the prices of corn, beans, and wheat are likely to move higher because of economic factors, a weather event in 2021 has the potential to ignite rallies that could take prices to new all-time highs given the ever-growing demand side of this fundamental equation.</p>

While more employers are seeking workers, hiring fell 2 percent compared to January to 5.3 million. Job openings have increased 3.2 percent over the past 12 months.</p>
<p>More than 2.5 million people quit their jobs in February, but that was a sharp 19.6 percent decline from January. More people quitting their job is a positive sign because workers typically only quit one job when they have another job, or are optimistic they can find one. And the reason workers change jobs is typically motivated by better pay. So, this is where optimism meets reality.</p>
<p>The <a href=""http://www.nfib.com/surveys/small-business-economic-trends/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">National Federation of Independent Business</a> said its monthly sentiment gauge fell 0.6 point to 104.7. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/nfib-small-business-optimism-537"" id=""5fc343c4b878c"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""537"">Small business optimism</a></span> declined as <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/economic-calendar/retail-sales-256"" id=""5fc343c4b8856"" class=""js-hover-me"" hoverme=""eel"" data-eventid=""256"">sales</a></span> expectations and earnings came back to earth after a post-election surge.</p>
<p>In March, some warning signs appeared. The uncertainty index rose to 93, its second-highest reading on record. Bill Dunkelberg, the groups chief economist, noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More small business owners are having a difficult time anticipating the factors that affect their businesses, especially government policy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But pessimism was widespread in March. Of 10 survey components, only three notched an increase. Owners say theyre still struggling to find qualified labor: 85% report few or no qualified applicants for open positions. More survey respondents said finding qualified workers was their single biggest business problem, more than those citing weak sales. Economic expectations remain very elevated, with 46% expecting better conditions six months from now.</p>

<p>In the United States, farmers facing a fourth straight year of declining incomes and rising debts are hanging on to grain in the hope of higher prices later. They may be waiting a long time. The overflow in the United States has prompted a rush for temporary storage.</p>
<p>The USDA has approved permits for more than 1.2 billion bushels of temporary and emergency grain storage, such as tarp-covered piles and open-air mounds. Thats a record amount, according to the USDA. The USDA forecasts net farm income will fall 8.7 percent this year to $62.3 billion, the lowest level since 2009.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.marketwatch.com/story/critics-worry-this-provision-could-undermine-new-yorks-free-college-plan-2017-04-11"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">New York</a> lawmakers have approved a plan to make attending public colleges and universities free for students from middle-class families. New York is the first state to offer free four-year tuition. Previously, Tennessee and Oregon created programs that made community college tuition-free.</p>
<p>Altogether, the program is expected to cost New York $163 million and is expected to benefit roughly 940,000 families; although it might require a college degree to understand the details. The New York plan, nicknamed the Excelsior Scholarship, will be phased in over three years: Families earning up to $100,000 a year will qualify in 2017, families making up to $110,000 per year can participate in 2018 and families with income up to $125,000 can take part in the program in 2019.</p>
<p>Students must first apply for, and use, other money like federal Pell Grants, before turning to the scholarship. By zeroing out tuition, low-income students wont be able to use their other scholarship and grant money to cover living expenses. Books, fees, food, housing and incidentals arent covered by this scholarship, so students without family support must work or borrow.</p>
<p>The Excelsior Scholarship is good for two years for a two-year program like an associates degree, or four years for a four-year program. Only about one-third of students earn a degree in 4 years or less. There will be deferments for graduate school and extreme hardship.</p>
<p>The plan also requires students to work in New York state for at least two years after they receive an associates degree, or four years post-bachelors. If they leave, the full grant retroactively becomes a loan. This is how New York taxpayers will be repaid for their investment in a more educated workforce.</p>
<p>Its only April, and nine retailers have already filed for bankruptcy since the start of the year, as many as all of last year. Annual retail bankruptcies peaked at a total of 20 in 2008, a level that the U.S. could reach by September if the current rate of filings continues.</p>

On top of those closures, retailers that are staying in business, at least for now, are shutting down a record number of stores. More than 3,500 stores are expected to close over the next several months.</p>
<p>Traditional retailers with large fleets of physical stores have been hit the hardest. Visits to shopping malls have been declining for years with the rise of e-commerce and titanic shifts in how shoppers spend their money. Visits declined by 50% between 2010 and 2013. Malls across the country are struggling to stay open as stores close in droves. But its getting increasingly more difficult to find replacements for lost tenants.</p>
<p>By now youve seen the video of the United Airlines (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/united-continenta"" id=""5fc343c4b7fe1"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""13061"">UAL</a></span>) passenger dragged off the plane. This is a case study that will be re-lived in textbooks for years; an example of how not to do it. United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz today released another statement regarding the violent removal of a fare-paying passenger from one of his airlines flights over the weekend.</p>
<p>After two poorly received releases on Monday, Munoz has finally apologized to the customer. The tone of Munozs latest statement is a departure from his first, which apologized only for having to re-accommodate certain passengers. Yea, I remember watching Mike Tyson re-accommodate his opponents in the ring, but I never saw it on an airplane.</p>
<p>In a later letter, Munoz reaffirmed his support for his employees; their work just got much more difficult. And the apology would have resonated better if it had come out before United shares lost close to $1 billion in value intraday (shares closed down 1.1%, a loss of about $250 million). The incident is not all that surprising; rather it seems like a sign of the times.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we talked about the Wells Fargo (NYSE:<span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/equities/wells-fargo"" id=""5fc343c4b809b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""7992"">WFC</a></span>) report on its fake accounts scandal; which included $75 million in clawbacks from 2 key executives who were earlier fired. The chairman of the board was also making the media rounds trying to persuade skeptical newscasters that having Stumpf retain 3/4 of the pay hed earned when the abuses were underway was adequate.</p>
<p>The New York Times depicted the report as scathing. In fact, it is a carefully crafted document to dump all responsibility on Stumpf and Toldstedt, both of whom clearly are culpable, and shield the board and the new CEO. Anyone who knows much about banking will see clear footprints that the board ignored basic risk management failures and poor governance structures.</p>
<p>The report describes the glaring risk management failures. But the report tries to normalize them as being unfortunate features of how Wells did business that worked out badly rather than glaringly obvious control failures where not only top executives but ultimately the Board is responsible.</p>
<p>Even worse, the report proves the boards negligence by indicating it had noticed a major deficiency, that control functions were reporting to unit/profit center managers like Tolstedt, in 2013, yet was leisurely about addressing it. Keep in mind that is the same kind of deficient structure that led to the JP Morgan London Whale scandal.</p>
<p>It is a basic risk management failure to have control staff report to profit center managers.</p>
<p>The fact that the total hard dollar customer losses were small despite the brazenness and scale of the fraud was the big reason the former CEO thought he could brazen this out. And given that sanctimonious Wells had taken vastly more from customers via foreclosure abuses, this lackadaisical effort might have otherwise seemed reasonable.</p>
<p>After all, the traditional check on this kind of nickel and dime grifting, class action lawsuits, have become almost as rare as the dodo bird thanks to the successful efforts of Corporate America to cut them back.</p>
<p>Several prosecutors are supposedly still considering further action but dont expect much. Whistle-blower retaliation claims and other types of wrongful termination suits could be affected to add up to more serious payouts, and even more important, continued media focus on Wells bad conduct. Wells is not out of the woods, but sadly it is more likely to suffer the drip, drip, drip of individual cases than a prosecution or even a nice juicy civil suit against Stumpf or board members derelict in their duties.</p>
<p>And that is the problem C airlines can beat a passenger senseless and drag him like a slab of meat off the plane; banks can lie, steal and cheat C and in an extreme example, someone gets fired, they lose their multi-million dollar bonus, and that is that. Nothing much more. Business as usual.</p>        <div class=""clear""></div>"

This helped lift the metals and energy space and boosted most agricultural commodities. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc347ae49496"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">Oil</a></span> reversed as Trump tweeted it was too high.</p>
<h3><strong>Energy</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Crude Oil</strong> prices retreated from more than 3-month highs yesterday, posting the biggest one-day loss so far this year after U.S/ President Trump targeted OPEC with his tweets. Trump tweeted that oil prices were too high and that economies could not take another price hike. He called on OPEC to relax. The fact that Trumps decision to defer the March 1 deadline for additional tariffs on Chinese goods contributed to higher oil prices seems to have been ignored. Prices fell 2.9% yesterday, the biggest one-day fall since December 24.</p>

In addition, warehouse stocks of the metal tracked by the London Metal Exchange are at their lowest since 2005 as daily inventories have decreased in 15 of the last 16 days.</p>
<p>The rebound in copper prices since the start of the year has caught many speculative investors short. Data to February 5 shows investors reducing net short positions for a third straight week bringing them to the lowest since the week of December 18. Copper is now at 2.9310 and is eyeing the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the June to January decline at 3.0026.</p>

The 100-month moving average at 1,355.85 appears to be capping prices for now, as it has done since April last year.</p>
<p>Speculative investors increased their net long positions for a second straight week in the week to February 5, according to the most recent data snapshot from CFTC.</p>
<p><strong>Silver</strong> likewise has had a stable week of consolidation, lacking any direction with no impetus coming from a slightly weaker <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/usdollar"" id=""5fc347ae4a7ec"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""942611"">U.S. dollar</a></span> on the week.

<p>The rally has been assisted by supply concerns as a leading South African mining union threatened to broaden a labour strike that has been in place since November. In addition, Bloomberg has reported that platinum holdings in exchange-traded funds are now at their highest since October 2015.</p>
<p>The price discrepancy between platinum and palladium, which touched new record highs this week, has prompted many to speculate that platinum may take a more prominent role as a substitute for palladium in catalytic converters.</p>
<p><strong>Palladium</strong> touched 1,555.65 this morning, another record high, as the usual theme of short supply and rising demand continue to play out. <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/palladium"" id=""5fc347ae4aa1f"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8883"">Palladium</a></span> speculative investors snapped a two-week net selling profit-taking spree in the week to February 5, CFTC data shows.</p>
<h3><strong>Agriculture</strong></h3>

Prices continue to hold above the 100-day moving average at 3.658 and this average has supported prices on a closing basis since September 28. Corn is trading at 3.675 today.</p>
<p><strong>Sugar</strong> is consolidating last weeks move to the highest in nearly 12 months. Despite the recent gains, speculative accounts have been increasing negative bets on the commodity, with net shorts now at their highest since the week of January 8, the latest data from CFTC shows.</p>
<p>A series of supply-side news bytes is keeping <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc347ae4ab6e"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">wheat</a></span> under pressure this week. Firstly, warm weather in Chinas north is expected to boost wheat crops while the U.S. Department of Agricultures latest forecasts suggests <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc347ae4ac0e"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">U.S. wheat</a></span> output will increase to 1.902 million bushels in the 2019-20 season, an almost 1% jump from the previous season. Thirdly, Egypt, the worlds biggest wheat importer, expects a bumper wheat crop this year, according to the Agriculture Ministry. This would decrease demand on the global market.</p>
<p>Wheat touched the lowest since July in early trading this morning and looks poised for a fourth weekly loss in a row. The commodity is now at 4.624 and is testing the 200-week moving average support at 4.5985.</p>
<p><strong>Soybeans</strong> remain supported by trade talk hopes but have yet to break out of this years established range. Prices are now at 9.050, with the rising trendline support from the September low still intact, while the 100-day moving average at 8.8460 is set to move above the 200-day moving average at 8.8469 tomorrow. The 55-week moving average at 9.1931 might act as the next resistance level.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Since the <a href=""/quotes/us-dollar-index-historical-data"">dollar</a>s about-turn last week from one-year highs, global commodity markets have been left to find their own way through unique supply-demand fundamentals. And most have much to do on price recovery.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">With grains, its a different story.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Corn is rallying, resuming its run-up from December that was broken by Junes 11 percent drop C its biggest tumble in two years pressured partly by the resurgent dollar. With three sessions left to July, corn has covered decent ground this month, rising over 3 percent.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">For wheat, July has been its strongest in four months, as it rose nearly 7 percent to erase Junes 4% loss. Like corn, wheat has had a good year, rising in five of the past seven months, with Aprils rally alone at 13%, in reaction to weak spring output.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""></p><div class=""align_center""><div class=""contentMediaBox inlineblock""><img src=""https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic1f3fa86e45ba498c0952d62ef35c3714.jpeg"" alt=""Soybeans Daily Chart"" title=""Soybeans Daily Chart""><div class=""contentMediaBoxBottom defaultFont middle""><span class=""inlineblock middle imgCaptionText"">Soybeans Daily Chart</span></div></div></div><p></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While soybeans have the smallest advance of the lot for July C at under 0.5 percent C thats a rebound from Junes 15 percent slump. Last month was soybeans worst in four years as the market was pummeled by fears about the ongoing row on tariffs between Washington and Beijing, and what that could do to the soy trade in China, the largest consumer of the oilseed.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Strong Buy Across The Board</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Investing.coms daily technicals indicate a Strong Buy for all the three major US agricultural markets.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Analysts predict more gains, over the next month at least.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We believe that the US dollar is in the process of topping out. We think that by August the top will be complete and lead to an accelerated move down into the fall, adding a bullish tail wind to Ag commodity markets, said Shawn Hackett of Hackett Financial Advisors, a Boynton Beach, Florida-based investment advisory specializing in US agriculture.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We expect a series of rolling informed smart money algorithm buy signals in the ag complex to provide additional clues on the timing of the bullish turn, Hackett wrote in a weekly note.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Corn Rising On Ethanol Demand</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The rally in corn was largely supported by demand for <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/ethanol-futures"" id=""5fc347033610b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""961732"">ethanol</a></span>, the biofuel additive mandated at gas pumps, ADM Investor Services said in a separate note on Thursday.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Ethanol production for the week ending July 20 averaged 1.074 million barrels per day, up 0.94% on the week and 6.13% higher on the year.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">ADM noted that corn use needed to average 88.256 million bushels per week to meet this crop year's estimate of 5.575 billion bushels by the US Department of Agriculture. Stocks as of July 20 were 21.653 million barrels, down 0.53% from a week ago.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">All of these suggest to us that an early harvest low will be seen in the corn market with August as the likely month for a bullish turning point, Hackett said. The $3.40 per bushel area remains strong support on spot prices.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Investing.coms daily Fibonacci technicals for corn indicate support from $3.5998 to $3.5658 per bushel and resistance from $3.6418 to $3.6758, with the pivot at $3.6208.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Limited Rainfall For Soybeans</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">For soybeans, crop conditions were expected to come in weaker than expected, with the growing belt in the far West seeing limited rainfall starting in late July and into August, ADM said in a note from earlier in the week.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Hackett thinks that with the Chinese being the biggest soy consumers, prices of the bean and oilseed could benefit immensely with an easing of the current US-China tariffs war.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This would support the notion of an early harvest low with August as the ideal window for a bullish turning point, he added. The $8.40 area remains strong support on spot prices.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Investing.coms daily Fibonacci technicals for soybeans indicate support from $8.5748 to $8.4342 per bushel and resistance from $8.7486 to $8.8892, with the pivot at $8.6617.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Canadian Wheat Output Falters, China Stockpiles Tumble</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">For wheat, ADM cited continuing concerns about dry weather over the next two weeks in the Brazilian Parana states key wheat-growing areas. The 2018-19 Canadian all wheat output had also been lowered to 30.6 million tonnes, from a June estimate of 31.1 million, it said, quoting Agri-Food Canada.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Hackett adds that global wheat ending-stocks to usage out of China were at 10-year lows. The wheat market remains explosive here especially for high quality wheat. Strong support remains near $5.25 on MN (Hard Red Winter) wheat and $4.75 for (Kansas) Winter Wheat.</p>

Based on Thursdays settlement, that still gives bears room to sell the market down by almost 19 cents, or another 4%.</p>
<p>Few might have imagined things would get this bad for wheat within a year.</p>
<p>Bryce Knorr, senior market analyst at Farm Futures, reminisced in a mid-February column the overwhelming demand for the grain just two quarters back.</p>
<p>Knorr wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The wheat market had a bright, shining moment last summer, when threats to crops across Europe and into the Black Sea and Australia raised hopes the time was right for the U.S. to begin selling lots of wheat to a hungry world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cartel-style controls by top exporter Russia provided traders another reason to bid prices up then.</p>
<p>After a successful campaign in restricting exports during the summer to aid the rally in wheatjust like its current production-cutting pact with OPEC to boost <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc347c3c1ea3"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849""> oil</a></span> pricesRussia planned to limit shipments on some 18 million tons of the grain through June this year, industry sources said.</p>
<h3><strong>High Yields, Benign Weather Lead To Bumper Crop</strong></h3>
<p>That plan never came through. Knorr said better-than-expected grains yields outside of northern Europe and Australia resulted in a bumper crop as 2018 drew to a close.</p>
<p>He added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sales, by and large, were slow to materialize. Business finally picked up as the calendar flipped to 2019, but it may be too little, too late for a wheat market on the verge of life support.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scoville said that aside from the boon to global production from good European and Australian yields, benign weather in the U.S. was also helping the domestic wheat crop.</p>
<p>He added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fall season in both winter wheat regions featured a lot of rain that hurt harvest and planting all season long. Wet weather has continued for much of the winter, and it is likely that the crop will have good soil moisture to work with as it comes out of dormancy in the next month.""</p>

Corn production in 2020 is expected to rise. A story from Drew Powell with ABC News reported from Carson County Texas that Corn producers in the Texas Panhandle are banking on an increase in international exports to offset prices remaining flat. One farmer Dustin Babcock said, We hope for good yields and good yields will turn to a good profit, he further went on to say, I think the biggest struggle with Corn in 2019 was wet conditions at harvest. We had a wet fall and struggled to get the crop out. Mr. Babcock was right but geographically his neighbors to the north struggled with wet conditions and flooding rivers in planting season, and with flooded fields the horse already lest the barn before they could even consider harvest. Hopefully this will be a great year for farmers in 2020. In the overnight electronic session the March Corn is currently trading at 382 ?, which is ? of a cent higher.

<p>Good Morning!</p>
<p>Traders a couple years ago that there was not enough <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/indices/volatility-s-p-500"" id=""5fc347875b7fd"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""44336"">volatility</a></span> in the markets and everyone was selling premium in the VIX Index. And now there is plenty of volatility, which is scaring investors from participating. With may too many soundbites that have no reliability and or credibility the market sure seems to be shake, rattled and roll the market place. Private analytics firm IEG Vantage, formerly known as Informa Economics, IEG projected that U.S. farmers will add volatility acres while pulling back on <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-cotton-no.2"" id=""5fc347875ba1b"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8851"">Cotton</a></span>, <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-soybeans"" id=""5fc347875bacb"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8916"">Soybeans</a></span> and <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-wheat"" id=""5fc347875bb77"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8917"">Wheat</a></span> acreage. This is another headline that will add to where investors stand and trust especially with the U.S. C China trade talks that seem to create headlines good bad or different, Just the facts Mam. In the overnight electronic session the March <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/us-corn"" id=""5fc347875bc1d"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8918"">Corn</a></span> is currently trading at 378 ?, which is a ? of a cent lower. The trading range has been 379 ? to 377 ?.</p>
<p>On the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/ethanol-futures"" id=""5fc347875bcd1"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""961732"">Ethanol</a></span> front the February contract posted a trade at 1.272, which is .002 higher. 11 contracts traded and Open Interest is declining to 1,043 as we move closer to expiration and the March contract is showing more open positions. The February contract is currently showing 3 bids @ 1.269 and 4 offers @ 1.274.</p>
<p>On the <span class=""aqPopupWrapper js-hover-me-wrapper""><a href=""/commodities/crude-oil"" id=""5fc347875bd82"" class=""aqlink js-hover-me"" hoverme=""aql"" data-pairid=""8849"">Crude Oil</a></span> front we continue the whipsaw on headlines whether it is Iran, Venezuela or OPEC production cuts and what that means to the global economy.

<p>The USDA has released its monthly rice report for March. In 2015/16 farming season the US crops are expected to contract by 5% compared to the previous season. By the end of this season, rice stocks are to fall by 10% year on year to 43.9 mln hundredweights (1cwt=100 pounds, or around 45kg). Will the rice price edge up?</p>
<p>Global rice production is to total 417.1mln tons this season, which is 2% below the last years level according to USDA report. This is the lowest output in the recent 4 years. The production is expected to rise in India and to fall in Indonesia. At the same time, global rice consumption is likely to increase by 0.6% since previous year to 484.2mln tons. The USDA report forecasts the contracted rice crops will lead to 13% lower global stocks, which are to fall to 1.3mln tons.</p>

<p>On the daily chart <b>Rice: D1</b> is remaining in the downtrend. Nevertheless, the Parabolic and MACD indicators have formed the signals to buy. RSI is on the rise but has not yet reached the level of 50. It has been forming the positive divergence for a long time. The Bollinger bands have widened which may mean higher volatility. The bullish momentum may develop in case the rice prices surpass the last fractal high at 10.88. This level may serve the point of entry. The initial risk-limit may be placed below the Parabolic signal and the two last fractal lows at 10.21.</p>
<p>Having opened the pending order we shall move the stop to the next fractal low following the Parabolic and Bollinger signals. Thus, we are changing the probable profit/loss ratio to the breakeven point. The most risk-averse traders may switch to the 4-hour chart after the trade and place a stop-loss there, moving it in the direction of the trade. If the price meets the stop-loss level at 10.21 without reaching the order at 10.88, we recommend cancelling the position: the market sustains internal changes which were not taken into account.<br><b></b></p>

Meanwhile, Nigeria has said that it is totally committed to OPEC+ production agreements and confirmed 100% compliance with its own limits in November.Speculative investors remain bullish on the prospects for oil, adding to net long positions in the week to November 26, according to the latest data from CFTC.

The bulk of last months losses came on Friday, with a drop of 6.7%.

<p>The differing outcomes for the China and U.S. PMIs for October (China outperforming the U.S.) has had little impact on the precious metal.

<p>The gold/silver (Mint) ratio has been edging higher for the last four sessions, though there is a chance that streak may come to an end today. The 200-day moving average at 86.62 has been acting as near-term resistance since November 19.</p>

The precious metal has advanced almost 47% so far this year. Speculative investors pre-empted the last move as they turned net buyers for the first time in four weeks in the week to November 26, according to the latest report from CFTC.</p>

Recent surveys suggest that Indias sugar output for the current season may be 27.2 million tons, down 15% from the prior surveys conducted in March. The same surveys suggest Thailands sugar production will be down 10%. In addition, last week the International Sugar Organization revised its forecast for the 2019/20 global sugar deficit to 6.1 million tons, a 28% increase from a prior forecast.</p>
<p>Speculative investors have been caught wrong-footed by sugars recent rally as they are still net short of the commodity. However, shorts were scaled back for a fifth week to November 26, and they are now at the least since the week of July 16.</p>
<p>There has been a mild retracement in sugar of 1.4% so far this week which, if it continues, could bring a six-week rally to an end. However, prices may find support at the convergence of the 55- and 100-week moving averages at 0.1206 and 0.1202 respectively.</p><div class=""outerEleWrapper"">
